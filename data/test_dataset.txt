|0| You aren't the Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, but I know who you are. You're the impossible girl. Oh,he's very interested in you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why am I impossible?<|endoftext|>
|0| Hasn't he told you? The sly devil. Oh, dear me. Listen, soonwe'll wake. We'll strip you down for spare parts, then build aspaceship and move on.<|endoftext|>
|0| More Cybermen.<|endoftext|>
|0| They're waking from their tomb right now. You can either dieor live on as one of us.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Doctor will stop you.<|endoftext|>
|0| He can't even access the lips.<|endoftext|>
|1| Argh! Ow! Oh, that hurt. No, stop. Enough, Bit of pain, neuralsurge. Just what I needed. Thank you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why am I the impossible girl?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's just a thing in my head. I'll explain later.<|endoftext|>
|0| Chess game. Stakes?<|endoftext|>
|1| If he wins, I give up my mind and he gets access to all mymemories, along with knowledge of time travel. But, if I win, he'llbreak his promises to get out of my head and then kill us all anyway.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's not reassuring.<|endoftext|>
|1| No.<|endoftext|>
|0| Please tell me you can fix whatever happened to the children.<|endoftext|>
|1| Children. Yeah. They're fine. I mean, right now their brainsare just in stand by mode.<|endoftext|>
|0| That is not fine!<|endoftext|>
|0| Listen, right now they have a much better chance of gettingout of this situation alive than you do.<|endoftext|>
|0| Which one of you said that?<|endoftext|>
|0| Me. Cyberplanner. Mister Clever. Now, if you don't mind, Ihave a chess game to finish, and you have to die, pointlessly and veryfar from home. Toodle-oo.<|endoftext|>
|0| Apparently there are more Cybermen on theway.<|endoftext|>
|0| There's at least a dozen more shots left in the gun before itneeds to recharge.<|endoftext|>
|0| We might have more than a dozen Cybermen to worry about. What'sthat cable?<|endoftext|>
|0| Power line for the park.<|endoftext|>
|0| What wouldd happen if we unhooked the end, dropped it into themoat and turned it on?<|endoftext|>
|0| Fry anything alive that entered the water.<|endoftext|>
|0| Can Cybermen fly?<|endoftext|>
|0| No, ma'am.<|endoftext|>
|0| First good news of the day. Do it.<|endoftext|>
|1| Stop that. I felt that.<|endoftext|>
|0| Of course you did. It's time to get up. Wakey, wakey, boysand girls. Wakey, wakey.<|endoftext|>
|0| There, get that in you. Warm you up.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, thank you, Porridge.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oi, Clara!<|endoftext|>
|0| I'll see what he wants. Call me if there's any change.<|endoftext|>
|0| Right.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hey! Clara, there you are. Now, quickrundown. What's our weapons strength?<|endoftext|>
|0| One big gun, five of those hand-pulser units and a shiny blackbomb that implodes the planet.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah. Yeah, that one. Now, tell me, does it happen possibly tohave a remote triggery thing?<|endoftext|>
|1| Brilliant. Pass it here.<|endoftext|>
|0| No.<|endoftext|>
|1| Why not?<|endoftext|>
|0| In case you're not you right now. Or even if you are, just incase.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, don't worry. The Cyberplanner's hibernating between movesright now. Shush.<|endoftext|>
|0| Prove you're you. Tell me something only the Doctor knows.<|endoftext|>
|1| Clara, I suppose I'm the only one who knows how I feel aboutyou right now. How funny you are. So funny. And pretty. And the truthis, I'm starting to like you in a way that is more than just<|endoftext|>
|1| Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Yes! It's me. That really hurt. How did youknow that was him?<|endoftext|>
|0| Because even if that was true, which it is obviously not, I knowyou well enough to know that you would rather die than say it. Finishyour stupid game.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, let go.<|endoftext|>
|1| I can't. He's got control of the left arm. Argh, argh, no! No!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|1| He got what he wanted. He destroyed the trigger. My move.<|endoftext|>
|0| What do you mean, he got what he wanted?<|endoftext|>
|0| He means, good news, boys and girls. They're here!<|endoftext|>
|0| One gun, five hand-pulsers and a planet smashing bomb thatdoesn't work any more.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why not?<|endoftext|>
|0| Broken trigger unit.<|endoftext|>
|0| But you signed for that.<|endoftext|>
|0| I've learned so much from you, Doctor.It's been an education. But now, it's time for the endgame.<|endoftext|>
|0| Brilliant.<|endoftext|>
|0| Upgrade in progress.<|endoftext|>
|0| Damn. Who's our best shot?<|endoftext|>
|0| Probably it's me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Shoot any of them who make it across. The rest of you, takedefensive positions. Porridge?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes?<|endoftext|>
|0| Keep yourself safe.<|endoftext|>
|0| Alice Ferrin, you should have destroyed this planet when youhad the chance.<|endoftext|>
|0| They're nearly here. Now, you can takemy bishop and keep limping on for a little longer, or you can sacrificeyour queen and get the children back. But it's mate in five moves, andI get your mind.<|endoftext|>
|1| Takes my queen, and give me back the children.<|endoftext|>
|0| Emotions. Can't you see what a foolish move that was? You'velost the game.<|endoftext|>
|1| Kids back now.<|endoftext|>
|0| Emotions, Doctor, all for two human children you barely know.And it was a pointless sacrifice anyway. So, Doctor, do you think thechildren's death will affect your relationship with Miss Clara?<|endoftext|>
|0| Welcome to Webley's World of Wonders, children. Now presentingdelights, delicacies, and death.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|1| Angie, are you okay? Just look after Artie, okay?<|endoftext|>
|1| Your move. But before you take it, just so you know,sacrificing my queen was the best possible move I could have made. TheTime Lords invented chess. It's our game. And if you don't avoid mytrap, it gives me mate in three moves.<|endoftext|>
|0| How?<|endoftext|>
|0| I've got no charge left.<|endoftext|>
|0| How?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, come on. Call yourself a chess playing robot?<|endoftext|>
|0| How!<|endoftext|>
|1| You figure it out. Or don't you have the processing power, hmm?<|endoftext|>
|0| Please stand by. You will be upgraded.Welcome to the Cyberiad. You will be upgraded. Welcome to the Cyberiad.You will be upgraded.<|endoftext|>
|1| What are you doing?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor. Doctor, Doctor, Doctor, Doctor, Doctor, Doctor,Doctor. I'm pulling in extra processing power. Three millionCyberbrains are working on one tiny chess problem. How long do youthink it's going to take us to solve it?<|endoftext|>
|1| That's cheating.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, no, no, no, no. Just pulling in the local resources.<|endoftext|>
|0| There's no way you can get to mate in three moves.<|endoftext|>
|1| Three moves. Want to know what they are?<|endoftext|>
|0| You're lying.<|endoftext|>
|1| Move one, turn on sonic screwdriver. Move two, activate pulser.Move three, amplify pulser. See you.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's cheating!<|endoftext|>
|1| Just taking advantage of the local resources. Ah, hello. Cansomeone untie me, please?<|endoftext|>
|0| Do you think I'm pretty?<|endoftext|>
|1| No. You're too short and bossy, and your nose is all funny.<|endoftext|>
|0| Good enough. What happened to the Cyberplanner?<|endoftext|>
|1| Out of my head and redistributed across three million Cybermenright now, and about to wake them all up, kill us and startconstructing a spaceship. We need to destroy this planet before theycan get off it.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay, it has a fallback voice activation.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Captain, but she's dead.<|endoftext|>
|0| I think you should ask Porridge.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why?<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, he is the Emperor. I bet he knows the activation codes.Oh, come on. It's obvious. He looks exactly like he does on the coin,and on the waxwork, except they made him a bit taller, but look, am Ithe only one paying attention to anything around here?<|endoftext|>
|0| You are full of surprises. Porridge?<|endoftext|>
|0| She's right.<|endoftext|>
|0| So you can save us?<|endoftext|>
|0| We all die in the end. Does it matter how?<|endoftext|>
|0| What do we do?<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't want to be Emperor. If I activate that bomb, it's allover.<|endoftext|>
|1| And if you don't, three million Cybermen will spread across thegalaxy. Isn't that worth dying for?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor<|endoftext|>
|1| Three million Cybermen!<|endoftext|>
|0| The bomb, the throne, it's all connected. I just have to saythis is Emperor Ludens Nimrod Kendrick, called Longstaff the fortyfirst, the Defender of Humanity, Imperator of known space. Activate theDesolator. And it's done.<|endoftext|>
|0| It'll blow in about eighty seconds. Easily long enough forthe Imperial Flagship to locate me from my identification, warp jumpinto orbit, and transmat us to the State Room.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh yeah. Nice ship. Bit big. Not blueenough. Listen, there is a large blue box at coordinates six ultranineteen P. I need it transmatted up here right away.<|endoftext|>
|0| Right. Did you get that?<|endoftext|>
|0| And that's that. Seventy six, seventy seven, seventy eight,seventy nine<|endoftext|>
|0| Farewell, Cyberiad. You know, it was good to get away. Goodto be a person and not to be lonely, or Emperor of a thousand galaxieswith everyone waiting for me to tell them what to do.<|endoftext|>
|0| Can't you run away again?<|endoftext|>
|0| They'll be keeping a close eye on me this time. That's whathappens when you're Emperor. Loneliest job in the universe.<|endoftext|>
|0| You don't have to be lonely.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't. Clara, will you marry me?<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|0| He said<|endoftext|>
|0| She heard what he said.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're smart and you're beautiful, and I've never met anyonelike you before. And being Emperor won't be as hard if you're by myside. And you'd rule a thousand galaxies.<|endoftext|>
|1| This sounds like an actual marriage proposal. Tricky. Now, ifyou want my advice<|endoftext|>
|0| You, not one word. This is between me and the Emperor. Porridge,I don't want to rule a thousand galaxies.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah. Silly of me.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm really sorry.<|endoftext|>
|0| But that's stupid. You could be Queen of the universe. How canyou say no to that? When someone asks you if you want to be Queen ofthe universe, you say yes. You watch. One day, I'll be Queen of theuniverse.<|endoftext|>
|0| Of course, I could have you all executed, which is what aproper Emperor would do.<|endoftext|>
|1| You're not actually going to do that, though, are you? Oh,you're. Hey?<|endoftext|>
|0| Go on, get out of here, all of you, before I change my mind.<|endoftext|>
|0| Thank you for having me. It was veryinteresting.<|endoftext|>
|1| My pleasure. Thank you for coming. Now, I've got something foryou. It's not from me, it's from the Tardis. Ah. New phone.<|endoftext|>
|0| Thanks.<|endoftext|>
|1| You're welcome.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry I said this box was stupid.<|endoftext|>
|1| Bye.<|endoftext|>
|0| Bye. Thanks, Clara.<|endoftext|>
|0| Thanks, Clara's boyfriend.<|endoftext|>
|0| Thank you, Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| For what?<|endoftext|>
|0| Kid's day out. Getting us off the planet alive. Whatever youwere doing with the Cybermen. Good night. See you next Wednesday.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, a Wednesday, definitely. Next Wednesday, last Wednesday<|endoftext|>
|1| One of the Wednesdays. Impossible girl. A mystery wrapped in anenigma squeezed into a skirt that's just a little bit too tight. Ohyeah. What are you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Signs of any Cybertech remaining?<|endoftext|>
|0| No, Majesty.<|endoftext|>
|0| You ever wanted to be Emperor, Gloria?<|endoftext|>
|0| No, Majesty.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's the right answer. Come on. Let's go home.<|endoftext|>
|0| One day you meet the Doctor. Andof course, it's the best day ever. It's just the best day of your life.Because, because he's brilliant, and he's funny, and mad, and best ofall, he really needs you. The trick is, don't fall in love. I do thattrick quite a lot, sometimes twice a day. And once you start running,you start to forget, slowly. After a while, you just stop asking. Whoare you? Where are you from? What set you on your way and where are yougoing? Oh, and what is your name? You get used to not knowing. Ithought I never would. I was wrong. I know who he is. I know how hebegan and I know where he's going. I know the truth about the Doctorand his greatest secret. The day we went to Trenzalore.<|endoftext|>
|1| From the beginning, she was impossible. The Impossible Girl. Imet her in the Dalek Asylum. Never saw her face, and she died. I mether again in Victorian London, and she died. Saved my life both times,by giving her own. But now she's back and we're running together, andshe's perfect. Perfect in every way for me. Except she can't rememberthat we ever met. Clara. My Clara. Always brave, always funny, alwaysexactly what I need. Perfect. Too perfect. Get used to not knowing. Ithought I never would. I was wrong. I know who Clara Oswald is. I knowhow she came to be in my life, and I know what she will always mean. Ifound out the day we went to Trenzalore. <|endoftext|>
|0| Something wrong?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's the repair shop. What kind of idiot would steal a faultyTardis?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor? Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, what is it? What do you want?<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry, but you're about to make a very big mistake.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't know where I am. It's like I'mbreaking into a million pieces and there's only one thing I remember. Ihave to save the Doctor. He always looks different.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|0| But I always know it's him. Sometimes I think I'meverywhere at once, running every second just to find him.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|0| Just to save him.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|0| But he never hears me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oi.<|endoftext|>
|0| Almost never. I blew into this world on a leaf.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm still blowing. I don't think I'll ever land. I'm ClaraOswald. I'm the Impossible Girl. I was born to save the Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Do you hear the Whisper Men? The WhisperMen are near. If you hear the Whisper Men, then turn away your ear. Donot hear the Whisper men, whatever else you do. For once you've heardthe Whisper Men, they'll stop and look at you. One word from you couldsave me from the rope.<|endoftext|>
|0| Then you may rely on my silence.<|endoftext|>
|0| I have information. Valuable information.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you bargaining for your life? You have the blood offourteen women on your hands. There are no words you can speak thatwill save your neck.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Doctor. Ah, yes. I know all about him, your dangerousfriend.<|endoftext|>
|0| How?<|endoftext|>
|0| In the babble of the world, there are whispers, if you knowhow to listen. The Doctor has a secret, you know.<|endoftext|>
|0| He has many.<|endoftext|>
|0| He has one he will take to the grave. And it is discovered.Well?<|endoftext|>
|0| We can't let that terrible man live.<|endoftext|>
|0| He lives till I understand what he told me. We're going to needa conference call. I'll send out the invitations, you fetch thecandles.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, ma'am.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where's Strax got to?<|endoftext|>
|0| The usual. It's his weekend off.<|endoftext|>
|0| I wish he'd never discovered that place.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sontar-ha! Sontar-ha!<|endoftext|>
|0| Come here while I kill ye, ya filthy wee midden.<|endoftext|>
|0| Prepare to die in agony for the glory of the Sontaran Empire!<|endoftext|>
|0| Excuse me. Mister Strax?<|endoftext|>
|0| What is it, girl? Can't you see I'm trying to crush the brainsof this stinking primitive? Sorry about this.<|endoftext|>
|0| No problem.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's a telegram, sir. Very urgent.<|endoftext|>
|0| Conference call. Sorry, Archie. I'm going to have to ask you torender me unconscious.<|endoftext|>
|0| Fine.<|endoftext|>
|0| Better use this.<|endoftext|>
|0| It might take a while.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sleep well, my love.<|endoftext|>
|0| You too.<|endoftext|>
|0| The trap is set for the Doctor's friends. They willtravel where the Doctor ends.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, I like the new desktop.<|endoftext|>
|0| I was getting a little bored of the Taj Mahal. The tea shouldbe superb. It's drawn from one of my favourite memories. Strax, good ofyou to join us.<|endoftext|>
|0| It had better be important. I was in the middle of destroyingsome very pleasant primitives.<|endoftext|>
|0| I apologise for the interruption, but there is urgent newsconcerning the Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who else is coming?<|endoftext|>
|0| The women.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, no. You're going to try and make a soufflé again, aren'tyou?<|endoftext|>
|0| My mum's soufflé, yeah. Although this time I'll get it right.This time I will be Soufflé Girl.<|endoftext|>
|0| How can it be your mum's soufflé if you're making it?<|endoftext|>
|0| Because, Artie, it's like my mum always said. The soufflé isn'tthe soufflé, the soufflé is the recipe.<|endoftext|>
|0| Was your mum deep on puddings?<|endoftext|>
|0| She was a great woman.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's this?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, it arrived today. It's for you.<|endoftext|>
|0| My dearest Clara. The Doctorentrusted me with your contact details in the event of an emergency,and I fear one has now arisen. Assuming this letter will have reachedyou as planned, on April the tenth, 2013, please find and light theenclosed candle. It will release a soporific which will induce a trancestate, enabling direct communication across the years. However, as Irealise you have no reason to trust this letter, I have taken theliberty of embedding the same soporific into the fabric of the paperyou are now holding. Speak soon.<|endoftext|>
|0| So glad you could make it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where am I?<|endoftext|>
|0| Exactly where you were, but sleeping.<|endoftext|>
|0| Time travel has always been possible in dreams. We are awaitingonly one more participant.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, no. Not the one with the gigantic head?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's hair, Strax.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hair.<|endoftext|>
|0| Madame Vastra.<|endoftext|>
|0| Professor. Help yourself to some tea.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why, thank you.<|endoftext|>
|0| How did you do that?<|endoftext|>
|0| Disgracefully.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ah. Perhaps you two haven't met. This is the Doctor'scompanion. That is, his current travelling assistant.<|endoftext|>
|0| Assistant?<|endoftext|>
|0| Have you gone a darker green?<|endoftext|>
|0| Clara Oswald.<|endoftext|>
|0| Professor River Song. The Doctor might have mentioned me?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, yeah. Oh yeah, of course he has. Professor Song. Sorry, it'sjust I never realised you were a woman.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, neither did I.<|endoftext|>
|0| Perhaps we should get down to the business at hand.<|endoftext|>
|0| That might be good, dear, yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Clarence DeMarco. Murderer, under sentence of death. He offeredus this in exchange for his life.<|endoftext|>
|0| Space time coordinates.<|endoftext|>
|0| This, Mister DeMarco claims, is the location of the Doctor'sgreatest secret.<|endoftext|>
|0| Which is?<|endoftext|>
|0| We don't know. It's a secret.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Doctor does not discuss his secrets with anyone, my dear.If you're still entertaining the idea that you are an exception to thisrule, ask yourself one question. What is his name?<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, I know it.<|endoftext|>
|0| What, you know his name? He told you?<|endoftext|>
|0| I made him.<|endoftext|>
|0| How?<|endoftext|>
|0| It took a while.<|endoftext|>
|0| So you're a friend of his, then?<|endoftext|>
|0| A little more than a friend, a long time ago.<|endoftext|>
|0| He's still never contacted you?<|endoftext|>
|0| He doesn't like endings.<|endoftext|>
|0| So what else did this DeMarco tell you? He didn't just buy hislife with some coordinates. How did he prove their value?<|endoftext|>
|0| One word, only.<|endoftext|>
|0| What word?<|endoftext|>
|0| A word I've heard in connection with the Doctor before.Trenzalore.<|endoftext|>
|0| How exactly did he describe what he was giving you?<|endoftext|>
|0| The Doctor has a secret, you know. He has one he willtake to the grave. And it is discovered.<|endoftext|>
|0| You misunderstood.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ma'am, I'm sorry. I just realise I forgot to lock the doors.<|endoftext|>
|0| It doesn't matter, Jenny. What misunderstanding? Tell me.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, ma'am, please. I should've locked up before we went into thetrance.<|endoftext|>
|0| Jenny, it doesn't matter!<|endoftext|>
|0| Someone's broken in. Someone's with us. I can hear them.<|endoftext|>
|0| Jenny, are you all right?<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry, ma'am. So sorry. So sorry. So sorry. I think I've beenmurdered.<|endoftext|>
|0| Jenny!<|endoftext|>
|0| What's happened to her.<|endoftext|>
|0| Jenny, can you hear me?<|endoftext|>
|0| Speak to us, boy!<|endoftext|>
|0| Jenny!<|endoftext|>
|0| You're under attack. You must wake up now. Just wake up. Do it!<|endoftext|>
|0| Who are you? What have you done to her?<|endoftext|>
|0| You too, Strax. Wake up now!<|endoftext|>
|0| Tell the Doctor. Tell the Doctor. Tell the Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Tell him what?<|endoftext|>
|0| His friends are lost for ever more, unless he goes toTrenzalore.<|endoftext|>
|0| No! You can't say that. He can't go there. You know he can't.<|endoftext|>
|0| Angie? Artie?<|endoftext|>
|0| The Doctor can never go to Trenzalore.<|endoftext|>
|0| Am I getting warm?<|endoftext|>
|1| Angie? Artie? Am I getting warm? Am I getting warm?<|endoftext|>
|1| Am I getting warm? Look, I'm pretty sure you have to tell me ifI'm getting warm. I'm, I'm, I'm pretty sure that's in the rules.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|1| Ha! Clara. How are you? Don't worry, everything is undercontrol.<|endoftext|>
|0| What are you doing?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh. Mister Maitland went next door, so I said I'd look afterthe kids. They wanted to go to the cinema, but I said no. I said no,not until you wake up. I was very firm.<|endoftext|>
|0| At which point they suggested Blind Man's Buff.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes. Where are they?<|endoftext|>
|0| At the cinema.<|endoftext|>
|1| The little Daleks. What's wrong?<|endoftext|>
|0| So who was she, the lady with the funny name and the space hair?<|endoftext|>
|1| An old friend of mine.<|endoftext|>
|0| What, like an ex?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, an ex. River asked Vastra for the exact words. What werethey?<|endoftext|>
|0| The Doctor has a secret he will take to the grave. It isdiscovered. Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|1| Sorry. And it was Trenzalore? Definitely Trenzalore?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh dear. Sorry.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well?<|endoftext|>
|1| Trenzalore. I've heard the name, of course. Dorium mentionedit. A few others. Always suspected what it was, never wanted to findout myself. River would know, though. River always knew. Right, comehere. Give me your hand. Now, the coordinates you saw will still be inyour memory. I'm linking you into the Tardis telepathic circuit. Won'thurt a bit.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ow!<|endoftext|>
|1| I lied.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, what is Trenzalore? Is that your big secret?<|endoftext|>
|1| No.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, what then?<|endoftext|>
|1| When you are a time traveller, there is one place you mustnever go. One place in all of space and time you must never, ever findyourself.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where?<|endoftext|>
|1| You didn't listen, did you? You lot never do. That's theproblem. The Doctor has a secret he will take to the grave. It isdiscovered. He wasn't talking about my secret. No, no, no, that's notwhat's been found. He was talking about my grave. Trenzalore is whereI'm buried.<|endoftext|>
|0| How can you have a grave?<|endoftext|>
|1| Because we all do, somewhere out there in the future, waitingfor us.<|endoftext|>
|1| The trouble with time travel, you can actually end up visiting.<|endoftext|>
|0| But you're not going to. You just said it's the one place youmust never go.<|endoftext|>
|1| I have to save Vastra and Strax. Jenny too, if it's stillpossible. They, they cared for me during the dark times. Neverquestioned me, never judged me, they were just kind. I owe them. I havea duty. No point in telling you this is too dangerous.<|endoftext|>
|0| None at all. How can we save them?<|endoftext|>
|1| Apparently, by breaking into my own tomb.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's that?<|endoftext|>
|1| She's just figured out where we're going. She's against it. I'mabout to cross my own timeline in the biggest way possible. The Tardisdoesn't like it. She's fighting it. Hang on! Hang on!<|endoftext|>
|0| Now what?<|endoftext|>
|1| She doesn't want to land. She's shut down.<|endoftext|>
|0| So we're not there?<|endoftext|>
|1| We must be close.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay, so that's where I end up.<|endoftext|>
|1| Always thought maybe I'd retire. Take up watercolours orbee-keeping, or something. Apparently not.<|endoftext|>
|0| So, how do we get down there? Jump?<|endoftext|>
|1| Don't be silly. We fall.<|endoftext|>
|1| She's turned off practically everything, except the anti-gravs.Guess what I'm turning off.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oops.<|endoftext|>
|0| You okay? You're visiting your own grave. Anyone would bescared.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's more than that. I'm a time traveller. I've probablytime-travelled more than anyone else.<|endoftext|>
|0| Meaning?<|endoftext|>
|1| Meaning my grave is potentially the most dangerous place in theuniverse. Shall we?<|endoftext|>
|0| Gravestones are a big basic?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's a battlefield graveyard. My final battle.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why are some of them bigger?<|endoftext|>
|1| They're soldiers. The bigger the gravestone, the higher therank.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's a hell of a monument.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's the Tardis.<|endoftext|>
|0| I can see that.<|endoftext|>
|1| No. When a Tardis is dying, sometimes the dimension dams startbreaking down. They used to call it a size leak. All the bigger on theinside starts leaking to the outside. It grows. When I say that's theTardis, I don't mean it looks like the Tardis, I mean it actually isthe Tardis. My Tardis from the future. What else would they bury me in?<|endoftext|>
|0| Clara. Don't speak, don't say my name. He can't see or hear me.Only you can.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, come on, then.<|endoftext|>
|0| We're mentally linked. It's the conference call. I kept the lineopen.<|endoftext|>
|1| Who are you talking to? We need to get. River.<|endoftext|>
|0| That can't be right.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, it can't.<|endoftext|>
|0| She's not dead.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, she's dead, I'm afraid. She's been dead for a very longtime.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, probably should have mentioned that. Never the right time.<|endoftext|>
|0| But I met her.<|endoftext|>
|1| Long story. But her grave can't be here.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|0| This man must fall as all men must. The fate of all isalways dust.<|endoftext|>
|0| If it isn't my gravestone, then what is it?<|endoftext|>
|0| What do you think that gravestone really is?<|endoftext|>
|1| The gravestone?<|endoftext|>
|0| Maybe it's a false grave.<|endoftext|>
|0| Maybe it's a false grave.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, maybe.<|endoftext|>
|0| Maybe it's a secret entrance to the tomb.<|endoftext|>
|0| Maybe it's a secret entrance to the tomb!<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, of course. Makes sense. They'd never bury my wife outhere.<|endoftext|>
|0| Your what?<|endoftext|>
|0| The man who lies will lie no more when this man lies atTrenzalore.<|endoftext|>
|0| This base is surrounded! Lay down your weapons and your deathswill be merciful!<|endoftext|>
|0| Jenny. Jenny!<|endoftext|>
|0| This planet is now property of the Sontaran Empire. Surrenderyour women and intellectuals.<|endoftext|>
|0| Strax, please! She's dead.<|endoftext|>
|0| No heart beat. Complete cardio-collapse, shock induced.<|endoftext|>
|0| Get her back for me. Get her back for me now or I will cut youinto pieces.<|endoftext|>
|0| Unhand me, ridiculous reptile.<|endoftext|>
|0| There we go. Just a standard electro-cardio restart. She'll befine.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you all right, my love? Can you hear me?<|endoftext|>
|0| The heart is a relatively simple thing.<|endoftext|>
|0| I have not found it to be so.<|endoftext|>
|0| I see you have repaired your pet. No matter. I was onlyattracting your attention. I presume I have it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor Simeon. This is not possible.<|endoftext|>
|0| And yet here we are, meeting again, so very far from home.<|endoftext|>
|0| But he died. You told me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Simeon died, but the creature that possessed him lived on. Itake it I am now talking to the Great Intelligence?<|endoftext|>
|0| Welcome to the final resting place of the cruel tyrant. Of theslaughterer of the ten billion, and the vessel of the final darkness.Welcome to the tomb of the Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where are we?<|endoftext|>
|1| Catacombs.<|endoftext|>
|0| I hate catacombs. So how come I met your dead wife?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh well, you know how it is when you lose someone close to you.I sort of made a back-up.<|endoftext|>
|0| I died saving him. In return, he saved me to a database in thebiggest library in the universe. Left me like a book on a shelf. Didn'teven say goodbye. He doesn't like endings.<|endoftext|>
|1| Clara, come on! Run, run!<|endoftext|>
|0| It was a minor skirmish, by the Doctor'sblood-soaked standards. Not exactly the Time War, but enough to finishhim. In the end, it was too much for the old man.<|endoftext|>
|0| Blood-soaked?<|endoftext|>
|0| The Doctor has been many things, but never blood-soaked.<|endoftext|>
|0| Tell that to the leader of the Sycorax, or Solomon the trader,or the Cybermen, or the Daleks. The Doctor lives his life in darkerhues, day upon day, and he will have other names before the end. TheStorm, the Beast, the Valeyard.<|endoftext|>
|0| Even if any of this were true, which I take the liberty ofdoubting, how did you come by this information?<|endoftext|>
|0| I am information.<|endoftext|>
|0| You were a mind without a body last time we met.<|endoftext|>
|0| And you were supposed to stay that way.<|endoftext|>
|0| Alas, I did.<|endoftext|>
|0| As you can see.<|endoftext|>
|1| Come on, quickly, we're in.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|1| Clara!<|endoftext|>
|1| Yowzah.<|endoftext|>
|1| Still a bit of a climb. I think I remember the way. Clara?Clara.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hey, it's okay. You're fine. The dimensioning forces this deepin the Tardis, they can make you a bit giddy.<|endoftext|>
|0| I know, I know. How do I know? How do I know that?<|endoftext|>
|1| Clara, it's okay. You're fine.<|endoftext|>
|0| Have we, have we done this before? We have. We have done thisbefore. Climbing through a wrecked Tardis.<|endoftext|>
|0| You said things, things I'm not supposed to remember.<|endoftext|>
|1| We can't do this now. The Tardis is a ruin. The telepathiccircuits are awakening memories you shouldn't even have. <|endoftext|>
|0| Why do I keep meeting you?<|endoftext|>
|1| Clara.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Dalek Asylum. There was a girl in a shipwreck andshe died saving my life. And she was you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Clara.<|endoftext|>
|0| In Victorian London there was a governess, who wasreally a barmaid, and she died. And she was you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Clara? Clara, what's wrong?<|endoftext|>
|0| What do you mean, you keep meeting me? You said I died. Howcould I die?<|endoftext|>
|1| That is not a conversation you should even remember.<|endoftext|>
|0| What do you mean I died?<|endoftext|>
|0| The girl who died he tried to save. She'll die againinside his grave.<|endoftext|>
|1| Run. Run!<|endoftext|>
|0| The doors require a key. The key is aword. And the word is the Doctor's.<|endoftext|>
|1| Here I am, late to my own funeral. Glad you could make it.Jenny.<|endoftext|>
|0| Open the door, Doctor. Speak, and open your tomb.<|endoftext|>
|1| No.<|endoftext|>
|0| Because you know what's in there?<|endoftext|>
|1| I will not open those doors.<|endoftext|>
|0| The key is a word lost to time. A secret hidden in the deepestshadow and know to you alone. The answer to a question.<|endoftext|>
|1| I will not open my tomb.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, what is your name? The Doctor's friends. Stop theirhearts.<|endoftext|>
|0| Madam, boys, combat formation. They are unarmed.<|endoftext|>
|0| So are we!<|endoftext|>
|0| Do not divulge our military secrets.<|endoftext|>
|1| Stop this. Leave them alone.<|endoftext|>
|0| Your name, Doctor. Answer me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|0| Do you want me to do that again?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor who?<|endoftext|>
|1| Please, stop it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor who?<|endoftext|>
|0| Unhand me, sir. Argh.<|endoftext|>
|1| Leave him alone. Let him be.<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't worry, sir. I think I've got him rattled.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor! Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor who?<|endoftext|>
|1| Please!<|endoftext|>
|0| The Tardis can still hear me. Lucky thing, since him indoors isbeing so useless.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why did you open the door, sir? I had them on the run.<|endoftext|>
|1| I didn't do it. I didn't say my name.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, but I did.<|endoftext|>
|1| Is everyone all right? Is everyone okay? Clara? Clara? Clara,are you okay?<|endoftext|>
|0| That was not nice.<|endoftext|>
|1| I know. I'm sorry. Now then, Doctor Simeon, or Mister GIntelligence, whatever I call you, do you know what's in there?<|endoftext|>
|0| For me, peace at last. For you, pain everlasting. Won't youinvite us in?<|endoftext|>
|0| What's that?<|endoftext|>
|1| What were you expecting, a body? Bodies are boring. I've hadloads of them. Nah, that's not what my tomb is for.<|endoftext|>
|0| But what is the light?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's beautiful.<|endoftext|>
|0| Should I destroy it?<|endoftext|>
|0| Shut up, Strax.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, explain. What is that?<|endoftext|>
|1| The tracks of my tears.<|endoftext|>
|0| Less poetry, Doctor. Just tell them.<|endoftext|>
|1| Time travel is damage. It's like a tear in the fabric ofreality. That is the scar tissue of my journey through the universe. Mypath through time and space from Gallifrey to Trenzalore.<|endoftext|>
|0| Have you ever thought what it's like to be wanderers inthe fourth dimension?<|endoftext|>
|0| Do I have the right?<|endoftext|>
|0| Daleks, Cybermen, they're still in the nursery comparedto us.<|endoftext|>
|0| There are corners of the universe that have bred themost dangerous things.<|endoftext|>
|0| You were fantastic. Absolutely fantastic.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm the Doctor. I'm from Gallifrey in the constellationof Kasterborous<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello, Stonehenge!<|endoftext|>
|1| My own personal time tunnel. All the days,<|endoftext|>
|0| It was the daisiest daisy I'd ever seen.<|endoftext|>
|1| Even the ones that I, er, even the ones that I haven't livedyet.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor. Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|1| No, no. Which is why I shouldn't be here. The paradoxes. It'svery bad.<|endoftext|>
|1| No. No. No. What are you doing? Somebody stop him!<|endoftext|>
|0| The Doctor's life is a open wound. And an open wound can beentered.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, it would destroy you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Not at all. It will kill me. It will destroy you. I can rewriteyour every living moment. I can turn every one of you victories intodefeats. Poison every friendship. Deliver pain to your every breath.<|endoftext|>
|1| It will burn you up. Once you go through, you can't come back.You will be scattered along my timeline like confetti.<|endoftext|>
|0| It matters not, Doctor. You thwarted me at every turn. Now youwill give me peace, as I take my revenge on every second of your life.Goodbye. Goodbye, Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's wrong with him? What's happening?<|endoftext|>
|0| He's being rewritten. Simeon is attacking his entire timeline.He's dying all at once. The Dalek Asylum. Androzani.<|endoftext|>
|0| What did you say? Did you say the Dalek Asylum?<|endoftext|>
|0| Now he's dying in London, with us.<|endoftext|>
|0| It is done.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, dear Goddess.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's wrong?<|endoftext|>
|0| A universe without the Doctor. There will be consequences.Jenny, with me.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Dalek Asylum. You said it was me that saved you. How?Victorian London. How, how could I have been in Victorian London?<|endoftext|>
|1| No. Please, stop. My life, my whole life is burning.<|endoftext|>
|0| What are you scanning for?<|endoftext|>
|0| Local star systems.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why?<|endoftext|>
|0| Because they're disappearing.<|endoftext|>
|0| Disappearing how?<|endoftext|>
|0| The Doctor's timeline has been corrupted. His every victoryreversed. Think how many lives that man saved. How many worlds. Hesaved your life when we met. Jenny?<|endoftext|>
|0| Please, Jenny, no! Oh God, oh please, no.<|endoftext|>
|0| Reptile scum.<|endoftext|>
|0| You are an affront to Sontaran purity. Prepare to perish!<|endoftext|>
|0| We're friends. Strax, your past is changing, but I swear, weare comrades!<|endoftext|>
|0| Die, reptile.<|endoftext|>
|0| Strax! Strax!<|endoftext|>
|0| I have to go in there.<|endoftext|>
|1| Please, please, no.<|endoftext|>
|0| But this is what I've already done. You've already seen me doit. I'm the Impossible Girl, and this is why.<|endoftext|>
|0| Whatever you're thinking of doing, don't.<|endoftext|>
|0| If I step in there, what happens?<|endoftext|>
|0| The time winds will tear you into a million pieces. A millionversions of you, living and dying all over time and space, like echoes.<|endoftext|>
|0| But the echoes could save the Doctor, right?<|endoftext|>
|0| But they won't be you. The real you will die. They'll just becopies.<|endoftext|>
|0| But they'll be real enough to save him. It's like my mum said.The soufflé isn't the soufflé, the soufflé is the recipe. It's the onlyway to save him, isn't it?<|endoftext|>
|0| The stars are going out. And Jenny and Strax are dead. Theremust be something we can do.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, how about that? I'm soufflé girl after all.<|endoftext|>
|1| No. Please.<|endoftext|>
|0| If this works, get out of here as fast as you can. And spare mea thought now and then.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, Clara.<|endoftext|>
|0| In fact, you know what? Run. Run, you clever boy, and rememberme.<|endoftext|>
|1| No. Clara!<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't know where I am.<|endoftext|>
|1| Clara!<|endoftext|>
|0| I just know I'm running. Sometimes it's like I've lived athousand lives in a thousand places. I'm born, I live, I die. Andalways, there's the Doctor. Always I'm running to save the Doctor againand again and again. Oi! And he hardly ever hears me. But I've alwaysbeen there.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, what is it? What do you want?<|endoftext|>
|0| Right from the very beginning.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry, but you're about to make a very big mistake. Don't stealthat one, steal this one. The navigation system's knackered, but you'llhave much more fun.<|endoftext|>
|0| Right from the day he started running.<|endoftext|>
|0| Run, you clever boy.<|endoftext|>
|0| And remember me.<|endoftext|>
|0| It was an unprovoked and violent attack, but that's no excuse.<|endoftext|>
|0| We're all restored. That's all that matters now.<|endoftext|>
|1| We are not all restored.<|endoftext|>
|0| You can't go in there. It's your own time stream, for God'ssake.<|endoftext|>
|1| I have to get her back.<|endoftext|>
|0| Of course, but not like this.<|endoftext|>
|0| But how?<|endoftext|>
|0| Is she still alive? It killed Doctor Simeon.<|endoftext|>
|1| Clara's got one advantage over the Great Intelligence.<|endoftext|>
|0| Which is?<|endoftext|>
|1| Me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, please listen to me. At least hear me.<|endoftext|>
|1| Now, if I don't come back, and I might not<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|1| Go to the Tardis. The fast return protocols should be on.She'll take you home, then shut herself down.<|endoftext|>
|0| There has to be another way. Use the Tardis, use something. Saveher, yes, but for God's sake be sensible.<|endoftext|>
|0| How are you even doing that? I'm not really here.<|endoftext|>
|1| You are always here to me. And I always listen, and I canalways see you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Then why didn't you speak to me?<|endoftext|>
|1| Because I thought it would hurt too much.<|endoftext|>
|0| I believe I could have coped.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, I thought it would hurt me. And I was right.<|endoftext|>
|1| Since nobody else in this room can see you, God knows how thatlooked. There is a time to live and a time to sleep. You are an echo,River. Like Clara. Like all of us, in the end. My fault, I know, butyou should've faded by now.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's hard to leave when you haven't said goodbye.<|endoftext|>
|1| Then tell me, because I don't know. How do I say it?<|endoftext|>
|0| There's only one way I'd accept. If you ever loved me, say itlike you're going to come back.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, then. See you around, Professor River Song.<|endoftext|>
|0| Till the next time, Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| Don't wait up.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, there's one more thing.<|endoftext|>
|1| Isn't there always?<|endoftext|>
|0| I was mentally linked with Clara. If she's really dead, then howcan I still be here?<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay, how?<|endoftext|>
|0| Spoilers. Goodbye, sweetie.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't know where I am. I don't knowwhere I'm going or where I've been. I was born to save the Doctor, butthe Doctor is safe now. I'm the Impossible Girl, and my story is done.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor! Please, please, I don't know where I am.<|endoftext|>
|0| Clara. You can hear me. I know you can.<|endoftext|>
|0| I can't see you.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm everywhere. You're inside my time stream. Everythingaround you is me.<|endoftext|>
|0| I can see you.<|endoftext|>
|0| All your different faces, they're here.<|endoftext|>
|0| Those are my ghosts. My past. Every good day, every badday.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's wrong? What's happening?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm inside my own time stream. It's collapsing in onitself.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, get out then.<|endoftext|>
|0| Not until I've got you.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't even know who I am.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're my Impossible Girl. I'm sending you something. Notfrom my past, from yours. Look up. Look.<|endoftext|>
|0| This is you, Clara. Everything you were or will be. Takeit. You blew into the world on this leaf. Hold tight. It will take youhome.<|endoftext|>
|0| Clara! Clara! Come on. Come on, to me, now.<|endoftext|>
|1| You can do it. I know you can.<|endoftext|>
|0| How?<|endoftext|>
|1| Because it's impossible. And you're my Impossible Girl. Howmany times have you saved me, Clara? Just this once, just for the hellof it, let me save you. You have to trust me, Clara. I'm real. Just onemore step.<|endoftext|>
|1| Clara, my Clara.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who's that?<|endoftext|>
|1| Never mind. Let's go back.<|endoftext|>
|0| But who is he?<|endoftext|>
|1| He's me. There's only me here, that's the point. Now let's getback.<|endoftext|>
|0| But I never saw that one. I saw all of you. Eleven faces, all ofthem you. You're the eleventh Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| I said he was me. I never said he was the Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't understand.<|endoftext|>
|1| Look, my name, my real name, that is not the point. The name Ichose is the Doctor. The name you choose, it's like, it's like apromise you make. He's the one who broke the promise.<|endoftext|>
|1| Clara? Clara? Clara!<|endoftext|>
|1| He is my secret.<|endoftext|>
|0| What I did, I did without choice.<|endoftext|>
|1| I know.<|endoftext|>
|0| In the name of peace and sanity.<|endoftext|>
|1| But not in the name of the Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Waste no more time arguing about what a good man should be.Be one. Marcus Aurelius.<|endoftext|>
|0| Have you been running?<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you okay? There was a call for you at the office, from yourdoctor.<|endoftext|>

|1| On the Moon.<|endoftext|>

|0| No. Learn anything?<|endoftext|>
|1| Not a thing.<|endoftext|>

|0| Inhaler.<|endoftext|>

|1| No kidding.<|endoftext|>

|0| Roger. New heading two zero seven. Changing course.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, can you hear me? I don't think he can hear me.<|endoftext|>
|1| Next time, would it kill you to knock?<|endoftext|>

|1| Kate Lethbridge Stewart, a word to the wise. As I'm sure yourfather would have told you, I don't like being picked up.<|endoftext|>
|0| That probably sounded better in his head.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm acting on instructions direct from the throne. Sealed ordersfrom her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth the First.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Queen? The First? Sorry, Elizabeth the First?<|endoftext|>

|1| I work for them.<|endoftext|>
|0| You have a job?<|endoftext|>

|1| It's the fall of Arcadia, Gallifrey's second city.<|endoftext|>
|0| But how is it doing that? How is that possible? It's an oilpainting in 3D.<|endoftext|>
|1| Time Lord art. Bigger on the inside. A slice of real time,frozen.<|endoftext|>
|0| Elizabeth told us where to find it, and its significance.<|endoftext|>
|0| You okay?<|endoftext|>
|1| He was there.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who was?<|endoftext|>
|1| Me. The other me. The one I don't talk about.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't understand.<|endoftext|>
|1| I've had many faces, many lives. I don't admit to all of them.There's one life I've tried very hard to forget. He was the Doctor whofought in the Time War, and that was the day he did it. The day I didit. The day he killed them all. The last day of the Time War. The warto end all wars between my people and the Daleks. And in that battlethere was a man with more blood on his hands than any other, a man whowould commit a crime that would silence the universe. And that man wasme.<|endoftext|>
|0| Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate.<|endoftext|>
|0| Message for the High Council, Priority Omega. Arcadia hasfallen. I repeat, Arcadia has fallen.<|endoftext|>
|0| Soldier, I'm going to need your gun.<|endoftext|>
|0| Exterminate! Exterminate. Exterminate!<|endoftext|>
|0| Please. Please, just don't.<|endoftext|>
|0| Alert! Alert! The Doctor is detected.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Doctor is surrounded!<|endoftext|>
|0| Inform High Command we have the Doctor. Seek, locate, destroy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Seek, locate, destroy. Seek<|endoftext|>
|0| The Doctor is escaping. What are these words? Explain. Explain.<|endoftext|>
|0| The High Council is in emergency session. They have plans oftheir own.<|endoftext|>
|0| To hell with the High Council. Their plans have alreadyfailed. Gallifrey's still in the line of fire. So, he was there then?<|endoftext|>
|0| He left a message, a written warning for the Daleks. He's afool.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, he's a madman.<|endoftext|>
|0| As you can see, sir, all Dalek fleets surrounding the planetnow converging on the capital, but the Sky Trenches are holding.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where did he go next?<|endoftext|>
|0| What does it matter? This is their biggest ever attack, sir.They're throwing everything at us<|endoftext|>
|0| Sir, we have a security breach to the Time Vaults.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Omega Arsenal, where all the forbidden weapons are lockedaway.<|endoftext|>
|0| They're not forbidden any more. We've used them all againstthe Daleks.<|endoftext|>
|0| No. No we haven't.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Moment is gone.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't understand. What is the Moment? I've never heard ofit.<|endoftext|>
|0| The galaxy eater. The final work of the ancients of Gallifrey.A weapon so powerful, the operating system became sentient. Accordingto legend, it developed a conscience.<|endoftext|>
|0| And we've never used it.<|endoftext|>
|0| How do you use a weapon of ultimate mass destruction when itcan stand in judgment on you? There is only one man who would even try.<|endoftext|>
|0| Time Lords of Gallifrey, Daleks of Skaro,I serve notice on you all. Too long I have stayed my hand. No more.Today you leave me no choice. Today, this war will end. No more. Nomore.<|endoftext|>
|0| How, how do you work? Why is there never a big red button?<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello? Is somebody there?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's nothing.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's just a wolf.<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't sit on that!<|endoftext|>
|0| Why not?<|endoftext|>
|0| Because it's not a chair, it's the most dangerous weapon inthe universe.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why can't it be both? Why did you park so far away? Didn't youwant her to see it?<|endoftext|>
|0| Want who to see?<|endoftext|>
|0| The Tardis. You walked for miles, and miles and miles and milesand miles.<|endoftext|>
|0| I was thinking<|endoftext|>
|0| I heard you.<|endoftext|>
|0| You heard me?<|endoftext|>
|0| No more. No more.<|endoftext|>
|0| No more.<|endoftext|>
|0| No more. No more.<|endoftext|>
|0| Stop it.<|endoftext|>
|0| No more.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who are you?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's activating. Get out of here.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ow!<|endoftext|>
|0| What's wrong?<|endoftext|>
|0| The interface is hot.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, I do my best.<|endoftext|>
|0| There's a power source inside. (penny drops) You're theinterface?<|endoftext|>
|0| They must have told you the Moment had a conscience. Hello! Oh,look at you. Stuck between a girl and a box. Story of your life, eh,Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|0| You know me?<|endoftext|>
|0| I hear you. All of you, jangling around in that dusty old headof yours. I chose this face and formespecially for you. It's from your past. Or possibly your future. Ialways get those two mixed up.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't have a future.<|endoftext|>
|0| I think I'm called Rose Tyler. No. Yes. No, sorry, no, no, inthis form, I'm called Bad Wolf. Are you afraid of the big bad wolf,Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|0| Stop calling me Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's the name in your head.<|endoftext|>
|0| It shouldn't be. I've been fighting this war for a long time.I've lost the right to be the Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Then you're the one to save us all.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| If I ever develop an ego, you've got the job.<|endoftext|>
|0| If you have been inside my head, then you know what I've seen.The suffering. Every moment in time and space is burning. It must end,and I intend to end it the only way I can.<|endoftext|>
|0| And you're going to use me to end it by killing them all,Daleks and Time Lords alike. I could, but there will be consequencesfor you.<|endoftext|>
|0| I have no desire to survive this.<|endoftext|>
|0| Then that's your punishment. If you do this, if you kill themall, then that's the consequence. You live. Gallifrey. You're going toburn it, and all those Daleks with it, but all those children too. Howmany children on Gallifrey right now?<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't know.<|endoftext|>
|0| One day you will count them. One terrible night. Do you want tosee what that will turn you into? Come on, aren't you curious?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm opening windows on your future. A tangle in time throughthe days to come, to the man today will make of you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, I wasn't expecting that.<|endoftext|>
|0| But the Time War's over. Why have youbrought us here to look at a painting?<|endoftext|>
|0| The painting only serves as Elizabeth's credentials, proof thatthe letter is from her. It's not why you're here.<|endoftext|>
|0| My dearest love, I hope the painting known as GallifreyFalls will serve as proof that it is your Elizabeth who writes to younow. You will recall that you pledged yourself to the safety of mykingdom. In this capacity I have appointed you as curator of the UnderGallery, where deadly danger to England is locked away. Should anydisturbance occur within its walls, it is my wish that you be summoned.God speed, gently husband.<|endoftext|>
|1| What happened?<|endoftext|>
|0| Easier to show you.<|endoftext|>
|0| McGillop. But that's not possible. I was just. Understood,sir. But why would I take it there?<|endoftext|>
|0| Elizabeth the First. You knew her, then?<|endoftext|>
|1| A long time ago.<|endoftext|>
|0| Allons-y! There you go, your Majesty, what did I tell you?Bigger on the inside.<|endoftext|>
|0| The door isn't. You nearly took my head off. It's normallyme who does that.<|endoftext|>
|0| Tell me, Doctor, why I'm wasting my time on you. I have warsto plan.<|endoftext|>
|0| You have a picnic to eat.<|endoftext|>
|0| You could help me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, I'm helping you eat the picnic.<|endoftext|>
|0| But you have a stomach for war. This face has seen conflict,it's as clear as day.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, I've seen conflict like you wouldn't believe. But itwasn't this face. But never mind that, your Majesty. Up on your feet.Up, up.<|endoftext|>
|0| How dare you? I'm the Queen of England.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm not English. Elizabeth, will you marry me?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, my dear sweet love. Of course I will.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ah, gotcha!<|endoftext|>
|0| My love?<|endoftext|>
|0| One, the real Elizabeth would never have accepted mymarriage proposal. Two, the real Elizabeth would notice when I justcasually mentioned having a different face. But then the real Elizabethisn't a shape-shifting alien from outer space. And<|endoftext|>
|0| Ding.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's that?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's a machine that goes ding. Made it myself. Lights up inthe presence of shape-shifter DNA. Ooo. Also it can microwave frozendinners from up to twenty feet and download comics from the future. Inever know when to stop.<|endoftext|>
|0| My love, I do not understand.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm not your love, and yes you do. You're a Zygon.<|endoftext|>
|0| A Zygon?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, stop it. It's over. A Zygon, yes. Big red rubbery thingcovered in suckers. Surprisingly good kisser. Think the real Queen ofEngland would just decide to share her throne with any old handsomebloke in a tight suit, just cos he's got amazing hair and a nice horse?Oh.<|endoftext|>
|0| It was the horse. I'm going to be King. Run!<|endoftext|>
|0| What's happening?<|endoftext|>
|0| We're being attacked by a shape-shifting alien from outerspace, formerly disguised as my horse.<|endoftext|>
|0| What does that mean?<|endoftext|>
|0| It means we're going to need a new horse.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where's it going?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'll hold it off. You run. Your people need you.<|endoftext|>
|0| And I need you alive for our wedding day.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, good work, Doctor. Nice one. The Virgin Queen? So muchfor history.<|endoftext|>
|0| Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh, very clever.<|endoftext|>
|0| Whatever you've got planned, forget it. I'm the Doctor. I'mnine hundred and four years old. I'm from the planet Gallifrey in theconstellation of Kasterborous. I am the Oncoming Storm, the Bringer ofDarkness, and you are basically just a rabbit, aren't you? Okay, carryon. Just a general warning.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|0| Elizabeth!<|endoftext|>
|0| That thing. Explain what it is. What does it want of us?<|endoftext|>
|0| That's what I'm trying to find out. Probably just yourplanet.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor. Step away from her, Doctor. That's not me. That'sthe creature.<|endoftext|>
|0| How is that possible? She's me. Doctor, she's me!<|endoftext|>
|0| I am indeed me. A compliment that cannot be extended toyourself.<|endoftext|>
|0| Extraordinary. The creature has captured my exact likeness.This is exceptional.<|endoftext|>
|0| Exceptional? A Queen would call it impertinent.<|endoftext|>
|0| A Queen would feel compelled to admire the skill of theexecution, before arranging one.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's not working.<|endoftext|>
|0| One might surmise that the creature would learn quickly toprotect itself from any simple means of detection.<|endoftext|>
|0| Clearly you understand the creature better than I. Butthen, you have the advantage.<|endoftext|>
|0| Back, both of you, now! That's a time fissure. A tear in thefabric of reality. Anything could happen.<|endoftext|>
|1| 10<|endoftext|>
|0| This way.<|endoftext|>
|0| Welcome to the Under Gallery. This is whereElizabeth the First kept all art deemed too dangerous for publicconsumption.<|endoftext|>
|1| Stone dust.<|endoftext|>
|0| Is it important?<|endoftext|>
|1| In twelve hundred years I've never stepped in anything thatwasn't.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oi, you. Are you sciency?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, er, well, er, yes.<|endoftext|>
|1| Got a name?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|1| Good. I've always wanted to meet someone called Yes. Now, Iwant this stone dust analysed. And I want a report in triplicate, withlots of graphs and diagrams and complicated sums on my desk, tomorrowmorning, ASAP, pronto,L O L. See? Job. Do I have a desk?<|endoftext|>
|0| No.<|endoftext|>
|1| And I want a desk.<|endoftext|>
|0| Get a team. Analyse the stone dust. Inhaler!<|endoftext|>
|0| Someday, you could just walk past a fez.<|endoftext|>
|1| Never gonna happen.<|endoftext|>
|0| As you instructed, nothing has been touched.<|endoftext|>
|0| This is why we called you in.<|endoftext|>
|0| 3D again.<|endoftext|>
|1| Interesting.<|endoftext|>
|0| The broken glass?<|endoftext|>
|1| No, where it's broken from. Look at the shatter pattern. Theglass on all these paintings has been broken from the inside.<|endoftext|>
|0| As you can see, all the paintings are landscapes. No figures ofany kind.<|endoftext|>
|1| So?<|endoftext|>
|0| There used to be.<|endoftext|>
|0| Something's got out the paintings.<|endoftext|>
|1| Lots of somethings. Dangerous.<|endoftext|>
|0| This whole place has been searched. There's nothing here thatshouldn't be, and nothing's got out.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh no, not now.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, what is it?<|endoftext|>
|1| No, not now. I'm busy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Is it to do with the paintings?<|endoftext|>
|1| No, no. This is different. I remember this. Almost remember.Oh, of course. This is where I come in.<|endoftext|>
|1| Geronimo!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|0| Wait!<|endoftext|>
|1| Oof!<|endoftext|>
|0| Who is this man?<|endoftext|>
|0| That's just what I was wondering.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, that is skinny. That is proper skinny. I've never seen itfrom the outside. It's like a special effect. Oi!<|endoftext|>
|1| Ha! Matchstick man.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're not.<|endoftext|>
|0| Compensating.<|endoftext|>
|1| For what?<|endoftext|>
|0| Regeneration. It's a lottery.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, he's cool. Isn't he cool? I'm the Doctor and I'm all cool.Oops, I'm wearing sandshoes.<|endoftext|>
|0| What are you doing here? I'm busy.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, busy. I see. Is that what we're calling it, eh? Eh?<|endoftext|>
|1| Hello, ladies.<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't start.<|endoftext|>
|1| Listen, what you get up to in the privacy of your ownregeneration is your business.<|endoftext|>
|0| One of them is a Zygon.<|endoftext|>
|1| Urgh. I'm not judging you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, lovely.<|endoftext|>
|1| Your Majesties. Probably a good time to run.<|endoftext|>
|0| But what about the creature?<|endoftext|>
|0| Elizabeth, whichever one of you is the real one, turn andrun in the opposite direction to the other one.<|endoftext|>
|0| Of course, my love.<|endoftext|>
|0| Stay alive, my love. I am not done with you yet.<|endoftext|>
|0| Thanks. Lovely.<|endoftext|>
|0| I understand. Live for me, my darling. We shall betogether again.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, won't that be nice?<|endoftext|>
|1| One of those was a Zygon.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah.<|endoftext|>
|1| Big red rubbery thing covered in suckers.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah.<|endoftext|>
|1| Venom sacs in the tongue.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, I'm getting the point, thank you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Nice.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, is that you?<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah, hello, Clara. Can you hear me?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, it's me. We can hear you. Where areyou?<|endoftext|>
|1| Where are we?<|endoftext|>
|0| England, 1562.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who are you talking to?<|endoftext|>
|0| Myself.<|endoftext|>
|0| Can you come back through?<|endoftext|>
|1| Physical passage may not be possible in both directions. Its.Ah! Hang on. Fez incoming!<|endoftext|>
|0| Nothing here.<|endoftext|>
|0| So where did it go?<|endoftext|>
|0| Who's he talking to?<|endoftext|>
|0| He said himself.<|endoftext|>
|0| Keep him talking.<|endoftext|>
|0| Malcolm? Malcolm, I need you to send me one of my father'sincident files. Codenamed Cromer. 70s or 80s depending on the datingprotocol.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, you used to be me, you've done allthis before. What happens next?<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't remember.<|endoftext|>
|0| How can you forget this?<|endoftext|>
|1| Hey, hang on. It's not my fault. You're obviously not payingenough attention. Reverse the polarity!<|endoftext|>
|1| It's not working.<|endoftext|>
|0| We're both reversing the polarity.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, I know that.<|endoftext|>
|0| There's two of us. I'm reversing it, you're reversing itback again. We're confusing the polarity.<|endoftext|>
|0| Anyone lose a fez?<|endoftext|>
|0| You. How can you be here? More to the point, why are youhere?<|endoftext|>
|0| Good afternoon. I'm looking for the Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, you've certainly come to the right place.<|endoftext|>
|0| Good. Right. Well, who are you boys? Oh, of course. Are youhis companions?<|endoftext|>
|1| His companions?<|endoftext|>
|0| They get younger all the time. Well, if you could point me inthe general direction of the Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|0| Really?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah.<|endoftext|>
|0| Really.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're me? Both of you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yep.<|endoftext|>
|0| Even that one?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes!<|endoftext|>
|0| You're my future selves?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes!<|endoftext|>
|0| Am I having a midlife crisis? Why are you pointing yourscrewdrivers like that? They're scientific instruments, not waterpistols. Look like you've seen a ghost.<|endoftext|>
|0| Still, loving the posh gravelly thing. It's very convincing.<|endoftext|>
|1| Brave words, Dick van Dyke.<|endoftext|>
|0| Encircle them. Which of you is the Doctor? The Queen ofEngland is bewitched. I would have the Doctor's head.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, this has all the makings of your lucky day.<|endoftext|>
|0| I think there's three of them now.<|endoftext|>
|0| There's a precedent for that.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is that?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, the pointing again. They're screwdrivers! What are yougoing to do, assemble a cabinet at them?<|endoftext|>
|0| That thing, what witchcraft is it?<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah, yes. Now that you mention it, that is witchcraft. Yes, yes,yes. Witchy witchcraft. Hello? Hello in there. Excuse me. Hello!<|endoftext|>
|0| Am I talking to the wicked witch ofthe well?<|endoftext|>
|0| He means you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why am I the witch?<|endoftext|>
|0| Clara?<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello?<|endoftext|>
|1| Clara, hi, hello. Hello. Would you mindtelling these prattling mortals to get themselves begone?<|endoftext|>
|0| What he said.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, tiny bit more colour.<|endoftext|>
|0| Right. Prattling mortals, off you pop, or I'll turn you all intofrogs.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ooo, frogs. Nice. You heard her.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, what's going on?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's a timey-wimey thing.<|endoftext|>
|0| Timey what? Timey-wimey?<|endoftext|>
|0| I've no idea where he picks that stuff up.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Queen. The Queen.<|endoftext|>
|0| You don't seem to be kneeling. How tremendously brave ofyou.<|endoftext|>
|0| Which one are you? What happened to the other one?<|endoftext|>
|0| Indisposed. Long live the Queen.<|endoftext|>
|0| Long live the Queen.<|endoftext|>
|0| Arrest these men. Take them to the Tower.<|endoftext|>
|0| That is not the Queen of England, that's an alien duplicate.<|endoftext|>
|1| And you can take it from him, cos he's really checked.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, shut up.<|endoftext|>
|1| Venom sacs in the tongue.<|endoftext|>
|0| Seriously, stop it.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, hang on. The Tower.<|endoftext|>
|0| Did you say the Tower? Ah, yes,brilliant. Love the Tower.<|endoftext|>
|1| Breakfast at eight, please. Will there beWi-Fi?<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you capable of speaking without flapping your hands about?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes. No. I demand to be incarcerated in the Tower immediatelywith myco-conspirators Sandshoes and Granddad.<|endoftext|>
|0| Granddad?<|endoftext|>
|0| They're not sandshoes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, they are.<|endoftext|>
|0| Silence. The Tower is not to be taken lightly.<|endoftext|>
|0| Very few emerge again.<|endoftext|>
|0| Dear God, that man's clever. Come on.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where are we going?<|endoftext|>
|0| My office, otherwise known as the Tower of London.<|endoftext|>
|0| Come on, you lot, get in there.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ow.<|endoftext|>
|1| Three of us in one cell? That's going to cause some nastyanomalies if we don't get out soon.<|endoftext|>
|0| What are you doing?<|endoftext|>
|1| Getting us out.<|endoftext|>
|0| The sonic won't work on that, it's too primitive.<|endoftext|>
|1| Shall we ask for a better quality of door so we can escape?<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, so the Queen of England is now a Zygon. But never mindthat. Why are we all together? Why are we all here? Well, me andChinny, we were surprised, but you came looking for us. You knew it wasgoing to happen. Who told you?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oi, Chinny?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, you do have a chin.<|endoftext|>
|0| Marble, granite. A lot of different stone, but none of it fromthe fabric of the building. It's like somebody smashed up a lot of oldstatues. Are there any missing?<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't think so. Why would anyone do that, anyway? I mean, Iknow we're meant to keep an open mind, but are we supposed to believein creatures that can hide in oil paintings and have some sort of agrudge against statues? You all right?<|endoftext|>
|0| We have to go, right now, this minute.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's wrong?<|endoftext|>
|0| The things from the paintings. I know why they smashed thestatues.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why?<|endoftext|>
|0| Because they needed somewhere to hide.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Doctor will save me. The Doctor will save me. The Doctorwill save me. The Doctor will save me. The Doctor will save me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Excuse me. I'm going to need my inhaler. I so hate it when Iget one with a defect. Ooo, you've got some perfectly horrible memoriesin here, haven't you? So jealous of your pretty sister. I don't blameyou. I wish I'd copied her.<|endoftext|>
|0| So do I!<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, for goodness sake.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Doctor will be trying to send us amessage. We're looking for a string of numerals from around 1550,approximately. Priority One. I'm going to need access to the BlackArchive.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Black Archive. Highest security rating onthe planet. The entire staff have their memories wiped at the end ofevery shift. Automated memory filters in the ceiling. Access, please.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ma'am.<|endoftext|>
|0| Atkins, isn't it?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, ma'am. First day here.<|endoftext|>
|0| (sotto) Been here ten years.<|endoftext|>
|0| Lock and key? Bit basic, isn't it?<|endoftext|>
|0| Can't afford electronic security down here. Got to keep theDoctor out. The whole of the Tower is Tardis-proofed. He reallywouldn't approve of the collection.<|endoftext|>
|0| But you let me in.<|endoftext|>
|0| You have a top level security rating from your last visit.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry, my what?<|endoftext|>
|0| Apologies. We have to screen all his known associates. We can'thave information about the Doctor and the Tardis falling into the wronghands. The consequences could be disastrous.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is that?<|endoftext|>
|0| Time travel. A vortex manipulator bequeathed to the UNIT archiveby Captain Jack Harkness on the occasion of his death. Well, one ofthem. No one can know we have this, not even our allies.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why not?<|endoftext|>
|0| Think about it. Americans with the ability to rewrite history?You've seen their movies.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, so this is how we're going to rescue the Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm not sure there's enough power for a two-way trip. In anyevent, we don't have the activation code. The Doctor knows we havethis, so he's always kept the code from us. Let's hope he changes hismind.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes? Well, if you've found it, photograph it and send it to myphone.<|endoftext|>
|0| Er, Kate? Should they be here? Why have they followed us?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, they've probably just finished disposing of the humans a bitearly.<|endoftext|>
|0| The humans?<|endoftext|>
|0| Dear me. I really do get into character, don't I?<|endoftext|>
|0| The Under Gallery is secured.<|endoftext|>
|0| Prepare to dispose of one more human. We have acquired thedevice.<|endoftext|>
|0| Activation code, right?<|endoftext|>
|0| In theory, I can trigger an isolated sonic shift among themolecules, and the door should disintegrate.<|endoftext|>
|0| We'd have to calculate the exact harmonic resonance of theentire structure down to a sub-atomic level. Even the sonic would takeyears.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, no, the sonic would take centuries. Oh, we might as wellget started. Help to pass the timey-wimey. Do you have to talk likechildren? What is it that makes you so ashamed of being a grown up? Oh,the way you both look at me. What is that? I'm trying to think of abetter word than dread.<|endoftext|>
|0| It must be really recent for you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Recent?<|endoftext|>
|1| The Time War. The last day. The day you killed them all.<|endoftext|>
|0| The day we killed them all.<|endoftext|>
|1| Same thing.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's history for them. All decided. They think their future isreal. They don't know it's still up to you.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't talk about it.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're not talking about it. There's no one else here.<|endoftext|>
|0| Go on, ask them. Ask them what you need to know.<|endoftext|>
|0| Did you ever count?<|endoftext|>
|1| Count what?<|endoftext|>
|0| How many children there were on Gallifrey that day.<|endoftext|>
|1| I have absolutely no idea.<|endoftext|>
|0| How old are you now?<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah, I don't know. I lose track. Twelve hundred and something, Ithink, unless I'm lying. I can't remember if I'm lying about my age,that's how old I am.<|endoftext|>
|0| Four hundred years older than me, and in all that time you'venever even wondered how many there were? You never once counted?<|endoftext|>
|1| Tell me, what would be the point?<|endoftext|>
|0| Two point four seven billion.<|endoftext|>
|0| You did count!<|endoftext|>
|0| You forgot? Four hundred years, is that all it takes?<|endoftext|>
|1| I moved on.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where? Where can you be now that you can forget somethinglike that?<|endoftext|>
|1| Spoilers.<|endoftext|>
|0| No. No, no, no. For once I would like to know where I'mgoing.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, you really wouldn't.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't know who you are, either of you. I haven't got thefaintest idea.<|endoftext|>
|0| They're you. They're what you become if you destroy Gallifrey.The man who regrets and the man who forgets. The moment is coming. TheMoment is me. You have to decide.<|endoftext|>
|0| No.<|endoftext|>
|0| No?<|endoftext|>
|0| Just, no.<|endoftext|>
|0| Is something funny? Did I miss a funny thing?<|endoftext|>
|1| Sorry. It just occured to me. This is what I'm like when I'malone.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's the same screwdriver. Same software, different case.<|endoftext|>
|0| Four hundred years.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm sorry?<|endoftext|>
|0| At a software level, they're all the same device, aren't they.Same software, different case.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah.<|endoftext|>
|1| So.<|endoftext|>
|0| So, it would take centuries for the screwdriver to calculatehow to disintegrate the door. Scanning the door, implanting thecalculation as a permanent subroutine in the software architecture and,if you really are me, with your sandshoes and yourdickie bow, and that screwdriver is still mine, that calculation isstill going on.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, still going.<|endoftext|>
|1| Calculation complete.<|endoftext|>
|0| Same software, different face.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hey, four hundred years in four seconds. We may have had ourdifferences, which is frankly odd in the circumstances, but, I tell youwhat, boys. We are incredibly clever.<|endoftext|>
|1| How did you do that?<|endoftext|>
|0| It wasn't locked.<|endoftext|>
|1| Right.<|endoftext|>
|0| So they're both you, then, yeah?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes. You've met them before. Don't you remember?<|endoftext|>
|0| A bit. Nice suit.<|endoftext|>
|0| Thanks.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hang on. Three of you in one cell, and none of you thought totry the door?<|endoftext|>
|0| It should have been locked.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes. Exactly. Why wasn't it locked?<|endoftext|>
|0| Because I was fascinated to see what you would do uponescaping. I understand you're rather fond of this world. It's time Ithink you saw what's going to happen to it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Kate? Oh goodness, you're not actually dead. Oh, that'stremendous news. Those creatures, they turn themselves into copies. Andthey need to keep the original alive, refresh the image so to speak.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where, where did they go?<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't know. Oh, hang on, yes, I do. The Tower.<|endoftext|>
|0| If those creatures have got access to the Black Archive, we mayjust have lost control of the planet.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Zygons lost their own world. It burnt in the first daysof the Time War. A new home is required.<|endoftext|>
|0| So they want this one.<|endoftext|>
|0| Not yet. It's far too primitive. Zygons are used to acertain level of comfort.<|endoftext|>
|0| Commander, why are these creatures here?<|endoftext|>
|0| Because I say they should be. It is time you too weretranslated. Observe this. I believe you will find it fascinating.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's him! That's the Zygon in the picture now.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's not a picture, it's a stasis cube. Time Lord art. Frozeninstants in time, bigger on the inside, but could be deployed as<|endoftext|>
|0| Suspended animation. Oh, that's very good. The Zygons allpop inside the pictures, wait a few centuries till the planet's a bitmore interesting, and then out they come.<|endoftext|>
|1| You see, Clara, they're stored in the paintings in the UnderGallery, like cup-a-soups. Except you add time, if you can picturethat. Nobody could picture that. Forget I said cup-a-soups.<|endoftext|>
|0| And now the world is worth conquering. So the Zygons areinvading the future from the past.<|endoftext|>
|1| Exactly.<|endoftext|>
|0| And do you know why I know that you're a fake? Becauseyou're such a bad copy. It's not just the smell, or the unconvincinghair, or the atrocious teeth, or the eyes just a bit too closetogether, or the breath that could stun a horse. It's because myElizabeth, the real Elizabeth, would never be stupid enough to revealher own plan. Honestly, why would you do that?<|endoftext|>
|0| Because it's not my plan. And I am the real Elizabeth.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay. So, backtracking a moment just to lend context to myearlier remarks.<|endoftext|>
|0| My twin is dead in the forest. I am accustomed to takingprecautions.<|endoftext|>
|0| These Zygon creatures never even considered that it was mewho survived rather than their own commander. The arrogance thattypifies their kind.<|endoftext|>
|0| Zygons?<|endoftext|>
|0| Men.<|endoftext|>
|0| And you actually killed one of them?<|endoftext|>
|0| I may have the body of a weak and feeble woman, but at thetime, so did the Zygon. The future of my kingdom is imperilled. Doctor,can I rely on your service?<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, I'm going to need my Tardis.<|endoftext|>
|0| It has been procured already.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ah.<|endoftext|>
|0| But first, my love, you have a promise to keep.<|endoftext|>
|0| I now pronounce you man and wife.<|endoftext|>
|0| Woo hoo!<|endoftext|>
|0| You may kiss the bride.<|endoftext|>
|0| Is there a lot of this in the future?<|endoftext|>
|1| It does start to happen, yeah.<|endoftext|>
|0| God speed, my love.<|endoftext|>
|0| I will be right back.<|endoftext|>
|1| Right then, back to the future.<|endoftext|>
|0| You've let this place go a bit.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah, it's his grunge phase. He grows out of it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't you listen to them.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ow! The desktop is glitching.<|endoftext|>
|0| Three of us from different time zones. It's trying tocompensate.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hey, look. The round things.<|endoftext|>
|0| I love the round things.<|endoftext|>
|1| What are the round things?<|endoftext|>
|0| No idea.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh dear, the friction contrafibulator. Ha! There, stabilised.<|endoftext|>
|0| (channelling Doctor 2) Oh, you've redecorated. I don't likeit.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh. Oh yeah? Oh, you never do. Listen, we're going to theNational Gallery. The Zygons are underneath it.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, UNIT HQ. They followed us there in the Black Archive.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, so you've heard of that, then.<|endoftext|>
|0| The equipment here is phenomenal. Thehumans don't realise what half this stuff does. We could conquer theirworld in a day.<|endoftext|>
|0| We were fortunate, then, in our choice of duplicate.<|endoftext|>
|0| If I were human, I'd say it was Christmas.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, I'm afraid you wouldn't. We're not armed. You may relax.<|endoftext|>
|0| We are armed. You may not.<|endoftext|>
|0| Lock the door. I'm afraid we can't be interrupted. You don't mindif I get comfortable?<|endoftext|>
|0| You don't mind if I do?<|endoftext|>
|0| You'll realise there are protocols protecting this place. Osgood?<|endoftext|>
|0| In the event of any alien incursion, the contents of this roomare deemed so dangerous, it will self-destruct in<|endoftext|>
|0| Five minutes.<|endoftext|>
|0| There's a nuclear warhead twenty feet beneath us. Are you sittingcomfortably?<|endoftext|>
|0| You would destroy London?<|endoftext|>
|0| To save the world, yes, I would.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're bluffing.<|endoftext|>
|0| You really think so? Somewhere in your memory is a man calledBrigadier Alistair Gordon Lethbridge Stewart. I am his daughter.<|endoftext|>
|0| Science leads, Kate. Is that what you meant? Is that whatyour father meant?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|0| Space-Time Telegraph, Kate. A gift from me to your father,hotline straight to the Tardis.<|endoftext|>
|1| I know about the Black Archive and I knowabout the security protocol. Kate, please. Please tell me you are notabout to do something unbelievably stupid.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm sorry, Doctor. Switch it off.<|endoftext|>
|0| Not as sorry as you will be. This is not a decision you willever be able to live with.<|endoftext|>
|1| Kate, we're trying to bring the Tardis in. Why can't we land?<|endoftext|>
|0| I said, switch it off.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, Kate, please. Just listen to me!<|endoftext|>
|0| The Tower of London, totally Tardis-proof.<|endoftext|>
|0| How can they do that?<|endoftext|>
|1| Alien technology plus human stupidity. Trust me, it'sunbeatable.<|endoftext|>
|0| We don't need to land.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, we do. A tiny bit. Try and keep up.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, we don't. We don't. There is another way. Cup-a-soup. Whatis cup-a-soup?<|endoftext|>
|1| What happened?<|endoftext|>
|0| Easier to show you.<|endoftext|>
|0| McGillop.<|endoftext|>
|1| Take a look at your phone and confirm whoyou're talking to.<|endoftext|>
|0| But that's not possible. I was just<|endoftext|>
|1| You were just talking to me. I know. I'm a time traveller,figure it out. I need you to send the Gallifrey Falls painting to theBlack Archive.Understood? <|endoftext|>
|0| Understood, sir. But why would I take it there?<|endoftext|>
|0| One word from you would cancel the countdown.<|endoftext|>
|0| Quite so.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's keyed to your voiceprint.<|endoftext|>
|0| And mine alone.<|endoftext|>
|0| Cancel the detonation!<|endoftext|>
|0| Countermanded.<|endoftext|>
|0| Cancel the detonation.<|endoftext|>
|0| Countermanded.<|endoftext|>
|0| We only have to agree to live.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sadly, we can only agree to die.<|endoftext|>
|0| Please, Doctor. Please save us. Please save us. Please save us.<|endoftext|>
|0| Exterminate!<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm the Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| Sorry about the Dalek.<|endoftext|>
|0| Also the showing off.<|endoftext|>
|1| Kate Lethbridge Stewart, what in the name of sanity are youdoing?<|endoftext|>
|0| The countdown can only be halted at my personal command. There'snothing you can do.<|endoftext|>
|0| Except make you both agree to halt it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Not even three of you.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're about to murder millions of people.<|endoftext|>
|0| To save billions. How many times have you made that calculation?<|endoftext|>
|1| Once. Turned me into the man I am now. I'm not even sure whothat is any more.<|endoftext|>
|0| You tell yourself it's justified, but it's a lie. Becausewhat I did that day was wrong. Just wrong.<|endoftext|>
|1| And, because I got it wrong, I'm going to make you get itright.<|endoftext|>
|0| How?<|endoftext|>
|0| Any second now, you're going to stop that countdown. Both ofyou, together.<|endoftext|>
|1| Then you're going to negotiate the most perfect treaty of alltime.<|endoftext|>
|0| Safeguards all round, completely fair on both sides.<|endoftext|>
|1| And the key to perfect negotiation?<|endoftext|>
|0| Not knowing what side you're on.<|endoftext|>
|1| So, for the next few hours, until we decide to let you out<|endoftext|>
|0| No one in this room will be able to remember if they'rehuman<|endoftext|>
|1| Or Zygon.<|endoftext|>
|1| Whoops a daisy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Cancel the detonation!<|endoftext|>
|1| Peace in our time.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's funny, isn't it. If I'm a Zygon, then my clothes must beZygon, too. So, what happens if I lose a shoe or something?<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm Clara. We haven't really met yet.<|endoftext|>
|0| I look forward to it. Is there a problem?<|endoftext|>
|0| The Doctor, my, my Doctor, he's always talking about the day hedid it. The day he wiped out the Time Lords to stop the war.<|endoftext|>
|0| One would.<|endoftext|>
|0| You wouldn't. Because you haven't done it yet. It's still inyour future.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're very sure of yourself.<|endoftext|>
|0| He regrets it. I see it in his eyes every day. He'd do anythingto change it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Including saving all these people. How many worlds has hisregret saved, do you think? Look over there. Humans and Zygons workingtogether in peace. How did you know?<|endoftext|>
|0| Your eyes. You're so much younger.<|endoftext|>
|0| Then, all things considered, it's time I grew up. I've seenall I needed. The moment has come.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm ready.<|endoftext|>
|0| I know you are.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who's there? Who were you talking to?<|endoftext|>
|0| You wanted a big red button.<|endoftext|>
|0| One big bang, no more Time Lords. No more Daleks. Are you sure?<|endoftext|>
|0| I was sure when I came in here. There is no other way.<|endoftext|>
|0| You've seen the men you will become.<|endoftext|>
|0| Those men. Extraordinary.<|endoftext|>
|0| They were you.<|endoftext|>
|0| No. They are the Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're the Doctor, too.<|endoftext|>
|0| No. Great men are forged in fire. It is the privilege oflesser men to light the flame, whatever the cost.<|endoftext|>
|0| You know the sound the Tardis makes? That wheezing, groaning.That sound brings hope wherever it goes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes. Yes, I like to think it does.<|endoftext|>
|0| To anyone who hears it, Doctor. Anyone, however lost.<|endoftext|>
|0| Even you.<|endoftext|>
|0| I told you. He hasn't done it yet.<|endoftext|>
|0| Go away now, all of you. This is for me.<|endoftext|>
|0| These events should be time-locked. We shouldn't even behere.<|endoftext|>
|1| So something let us through.<|endoftext|>
|0| You clever boys.<|endoftext|>
|0| Go back. Go back to your lives. Go and be the Doctor that Icould never be. Make it worthwhile.<|endoftext|>
|0| All those years, burying you in my memory.<|endoftext|>
|1| Pretending you didn't exist. Keeping you a secret, even frommyself.<|endoftext|>
|0| Pretending you weren't the Doctor, when you were the Doctormore than anybody else.<|endoftext|>
|1| You were the Doctor on the day it wasn't possible to get itright.<|endoftext|>
|0| But this time<|endoftext|>
|1| You don't have to do it alone.<|endoftext|>
|0| Thank you.<|endoftext|>
|0| What we do today is not out of fear or hatred. It is donebecause there is no other way.<|endoftext|>
|1| And it is done in the name of the many live we are failing tosave.<|endoftext|>
|1| What? What is it? What?<|endoftext|>
|0| Nothing.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, it's something. Tell me.<|endoftext|>
|0| You told me you wiped out your own people. I just. I neverpictured you doing it, that's all.<|endoftext|>
|0| Take a closer look.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's happening?<|endoftext|>
|0| Nothing. It's a projection.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's a reality around you.<|endoftext|>
|0| These are the people you're going to burn?<|endoftext|>
|0| There isn't anything we can do.<|endoftext|>
|1| He's right. There isn't another way. There never was. Either Idestroy my own people or let the universe burn.<|endoftext|>
|0| Look at you. The three of you. The warrior, the hero, and you.<|endoftext|>
|1| And what am I?<|endoftext|>
|0| Have you really forgotten?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes. Maybe, yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| We've got enough warriors. Any old idiot can be a hero.<|endoftext|>
|1| Then what do I do?<|endoftext|>
|0| What you've always done. Be a doctor. You told me the name youchose was a promise. What was the promise?<|endoftext|>
|0| Never cruel or cowardly.<|endoftext|>
|0| Never give up, never give in.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're not actually suggesting that we change our ownpersonal history?<|endoftext|>
|1| We change history all the time. I'm suggesting far worse.<|endoftext|>
|0| What, exactly?<|endoftext|>
|1| Gentlemen, I have had four hundred years to think about this.I've changed my mind.<|endoftext|>
|0| There's still a billion billion Daleks up there, attacking.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, there is. There is.<|endoftext|>
|0| But there's something those billion billion Daleks don'tknow.<|endoftext|>
|1| Because if they did, they'd probably send for reinforcements.<|endoftext|>
|0| What? What don't they know?<|endoftext|>
|1| This time, there's three of us.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh! Oh, yes, that is good. That is brilliant!<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, oh, oh, I'm getting that too! That is brilliant!<|endoftext|>
|1| Ha, ha, ha! I've been thinking about it for centuries.<|endoftext|>
|0| She didn't just show me any old future, she showed me exactlythe future I needed to see.<|endoftext|>
|0| Now you're getting it.<|endoftext|>
|1| Eh? Who did?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, Bad Wolf girl, I could kiss you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, that's going to happen.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry, did you just say Bad Wolf?<|endoftext|>
|0| So what are we doing? What's the plan?<|endoftext|>
|0| The Dalek fleets are surrounding Gallifrey, firing on itconstantly.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Sky Trench is holding, but what if the whole planet justdisappeared?<|endoftext|>
|0| Tiny bit of an ask.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Daleks would be firing on each other. They'd destroythemselves in their own crossfire.<|endoftext|>
|0| Gallifrey would be gone, the Daleks would be destroyed, and itwould look to the rest of the universe as if they'd annihilated eachother.<|endoftext|>
|0| But where would Gallifrey be?<|endoftext|>
|0| Frozen. Frozen in an instant of time, safe and hidden away.<|endoftext|>
|1| Exactly.<|endoftext|>
|0| Like a painting.<|endoftext|>
|0| Another one.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you sure the message is from him?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why would he do that?<|endoftext|>
|0| What's the mad fool talking about now?<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello, hello, Gallifrey High Command, this is theDoctor speaking.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello! Also the Doctor. Can you hear me?<|endoftext|>
|0| Also the Doctor, standing ready.<|endoftext|>
|0| Dear God, three of them. All my worst nightmares at once.<|endoftext|>
|0| General, we have a plan.<|endoftext|>
|1| We should point at this moment, it is afairly terrible plan<|endoftext|>
|0| And almost certainly won'twork.<|endoftext|>
|0| I was happy with fairly terrible.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry, just thinking out loud.<|endoftext|>
|1| We're flying our three Tardises into yourlower atmosphere.<|endoftext|>
|0| We're positioned at equidistantintervals around the globe. Equidistant. So grown up.<|endoftext|>
|0| We're just about ready to do it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ready to do what?<|endoftext|>
|1| We're going to freeze Gallifrey.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm sorry, what?<|endoftext|>
|0| Using our Tardises, we're going tofreeze Gallifrey in a single moment in time.<|endoftext|>
|0| You know, like those stasiscubes? A single moment in time, held in a parallel pocket universe.<|endoftext|>
|1| Except we're going to do it to a wholeplanet.<|endoftext|>
|0| And all the people on it.<|endoftext|>
|0| What? Even if that were possible<|endoftext|>
|0| Which it isn't, why would you do sucha thing?<|endoftext|>
|1| Because the alternative is burning.<|endoftext|>
|0| And I've seen that.<|endoftext|>
|1| And I never want to see it again.<|endoftext|>
|0| We'd be lost in another universe, frozenin a single moment. We'd have nothing.<|endoftext|>
|1| You would have hope. And right now, that isexactly what you don't have.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's delusional. The calculations alonewould take hundreds of years.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, hundreds and hundreds.<|endoftext|>
|0| But don't worry, I started a very long time ago.<|endoftext|>
|0| Calling the War Council of Gallifrey. This is the Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| You might say I've been doing this all my lives.<|endoftext|>
|0| Good luck.<|endoftext|>
|0| Standing by.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ready.<|endoftext|>
|0| Commencing calculations.<|endoftext|>
|0| Soon be there.<|endoftext|>
|0| Across the boundaries that divide one universefrom another.<|endoftext|>
|0| Just got to lock on to his coordinates.<|endoftext|>
|0| And for my next trick.<|endoftext|>
|0| I didn't know when I was well off. Alltwelve of them!<|endoftext|>
|0| No, sir. All thirteen!<|endoftext|>
|0| Sir! The Daleks know that something is happening. They'reincreasing their fire power.<|endoftext|>
|0| Do it, Doctor. Just do it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Just do it.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay. Gentlemen, we're ready. Geronimo!<|endoftext|>
|0| Allons-y!<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, for God's sake. Gallifrey stands!<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't suppose we'll know if we actually succeeded. But atworst, we failed doing the right thing, as opposed to succeeding indoing the wrong.<|endoftext|>
|0| Life and soul, you are.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is it actually called?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, there's some debate. Either No More or Gallifrey Falls.<|endoftext|>
|0| Not very encouraging.<|endoftext|>
|0| How did it get here?<|endoftext|>
|1| No idea.<|endoftext|>
|0| There's always something we don't know, isn't there?<|endoftext|>
|0| One should certainly hope so. Well, gentlemen, it has been anhonour and a privilege.<|endoftext|>
|0| Likewise.<|endoftext|>
|1| Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| And if I grow to be half the man that you are, Clara Oswald, Ishall be happy indeed.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's right. Aim high.<|endoftext|>
|0| I won't remember this, will I?<|endoftext|>
|1| The time streams are out of sync. You can't retain it, no.<|endoftext|>
|0| So I won't remember that I tried to save Gallifrey rather thanburn it. I'll have to live with that. But for now, for this moment, Iam the Doctor again. Thank you. Which one is mine? Ha!<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh yes, of course. I suppose it makes sense. Wearing a bitthin. I hope the ears are a bit less conspicuous this time.<|endoftext|>
|0| I won't remember either, so you might aswell tell me.<|endoftext|>
|1| Tell you what?<|endoftext|>
|0| Where it is we're going that you don't want to talk about.<|endoftext|>
|1| I saw Trenzalore, where we're buried. We die in battle amongmillions.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's not how it's supposed to be.<|endoftext|>
|1| That's how the story ends. Nothing we can do about it.Trenzalore is where you're going.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, never say nothing. Anyway, good to know my future is insafe hands. Keep a tight hold on it, Clara.<|endoftext|>
|0| On it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Trenzalore. We need a new destination, because I don't wantto go.<|endoftext|>
|1| He always says that.<|endoftext|>
|0| Need a moment alone with your painting?<|endoftext|>
|1| How did you know?<|endoftext|>
|0| Those big sad eyes.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah.<|endoftext|>
|0| I always know. Oh, by the way, there was an old man looking foryou. I think it was the curator.<|endoftext|>
|1| I could be a curator. I'd be great at curating. I'd be theGreat Curator. I could retire and do that. I could retire and be thecurator of this place.<|endoftext|>
|0| You know, I really think you might.<|endoftext|>
|1| I never forget a face.<|endoftext|>
|0| I know you don't. And in years to come, you might findyourself revisiting afew. But just the old favourites, eh?<|endoftext|>
|0| You were curious about this painting, I think. I acquired itin remarkable circumstances. What do you make of the title?<|endoftext|>
|1| Which title? There's two. No More or Gallifrey Falls.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, you see, that's where everybody's wrong. It's all onetitle. Gallifrey Falls No More. Now, what would youthink that means, eh?<|endoftext|>
|1| That Gallifrey didn't fall. It worked. It's still out there.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm only a humble curator. I'm sure I wouldn't know.<|endoftext|>
|1| Then where is it?<|endoftext|>
|0| Where is it indeed? Lost. Shush. Perhaps. Things do get lost,you know. And now you must excuse me. Oh, you have a lot to do.<|endoftext|>
|1| Do I?<|endoftext|>
|0| Mmm.<|endoftext|>
|1| Is that what I'm supposed to do now? Go looking for Gallifrey?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, it's entirely up to you. Your choice, eh? I can only tellyou what I would do if I were you. Oh, if I were you. Oh, perhaps I wasyou, of course. Or perhaps you are me. Congratulations.<|endoftext|>
|1| Thank you very much.<|endoftext|>
|0| Or perhaps it doesn't matter either way. Who knows, eh? Whoknows?<|endoftext|>
|0| Clara sometimes asks me if I dream. Ofcourse I dream, I tell her. Everybody dreams. But what do you dreamabout, she'll ask. The same thing everybody dreams about, I tell her. Idream about where I'm going. She always laughs at that. But you're notgoing anywhere, you're just wandering about.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's not true. Not any more. I have a new destination.My journey is the same as yours, the same as anyones. It's taken me somany years, so many lifetimes, but at last I know where I'm going.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where I've always been going. Home, the long way round.<|endoftext|>
|1| I bring proof of courage and comradeship. What is this ship andwhy are you here? Identify yourselves by species and planet of origin.<|endoftext|>
|0| Exterminate!<|endoftext|>
|1| Handles?<|endoftext|>
|0| Exterminate! Exterminate!<|endoftext|>
|1| Handles? Argh. Handles?<|endoftext|>
|0| Exterminate!<|endoftext|>
|1| Every ship I go on, they just shoot at me.Handles, I said, put me on a ship. I didn't say, put me on a Dalekship.<|endoftext|>
|1| Don't put me on a Dalek ship when I'm holding a broken bit ofDalek!<|endoftext|>
|1| Ow!<|endoftext|>
|0| You did not indicate a preference.<|endoftext|>
|1| Use your head.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's not like you've got a lot of alternatives. They're allhere. Daleks, Sontarans, Terileptils, Slitheen. And they're not evenfighting, they're just parked. Why?<|endoftext|>
|0| The message was received throughout the universe.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, yes, the message, the message. Even I can't translate it.I mean, why is everyone here if they don't understand it?<|endoftext|>
|0| You're here.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, you know, I'm OCD. What's their excuse? What does thismessage mean?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, no. And remind me I've got to patch the telephone backthrough the console unit. This is getting ridiculous.<|endoftext|>
|0| Attention. Information available.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay?<|endoftext|>
|0| You must patch the telephone device back through the consoleunit.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, no. No, no, no, no. No, not now. Remind me later.<|endoftext|>
|0| When?<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't know. Just later. Just pick a time.<|endoftext|>
|0| When?<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't know. Just any old time. When you think I've forgotten.<|endoftext|>
|0| When?<|endoftext|>
|1| Just pick a random number, express that number as a quantity ofminutes, and when that time has elapsed, remind me to patch thetelephone back through the console unit.<|endoftext|>
|0| Affirmative.<|endoftext|>
|1| How those Cyber-evenings must fly.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hello, the Tardis.<|endoftext|>
|0| Emergency. You're my boyfriend.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ding dong. Okay, brilliant. I may be a bit rusty in some areas,but I will glance at a manual.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, no, you're not actually my boyfriend.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, that was quick. It's a roller coaster this phone call.<|endoftext|>
|0| But I need a boyfriend really quickly.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, I hope you're nicer to the next one.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, shut up. Christmas dinner. Me cooking.<|endoftext|>
|1| So?<|endoftext|>
|0| So, I may have accidentally invented a boyfriend.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, I did that once and there's no easy way to get rid of anandroid.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, not an android. A pretend one, an imaginary one. And I saidhe'd be coming to Christmas dinner.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah.<|endoftext|>
|1| Handles, that's a new ship. Okay, we'll take the Tardis thistime.<|endoftext|>
|0| I just need you to come for Christmas dinner. Just do that forme. Come to Christmas dinner and be my Christmas date.<|endoftext|>
|1| Sorry, missed that last bit. Got to dash.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay, don't be alarmed, I come in<|endoftext|>
|0| Alert. Alert.<|endoftext|>
|1| Peace. No.<|endoftext|>
|0| Intruder detected. The intruder will be upgraded.<|endoftext|>
|1| Argh! Sorry.<|endoftext|>
|0| I need you. I'm cooking Christmas dinner!<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm being shot at by Cybermen!<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, can't we do both?<|endoftext|>
|1| Argh! Yeah, why not?<|endoftext|>
|0| Happy Christmas!<|endoftext|>
|0| How's the turkey doing?<|endoftext|>
|0| Great. Yeah, yeah, it's doing great. Well, dead and decapitated,but that's Christmas when you're a turkey.<|endoftext|>
|0| Actually, maybe I will have a little more.<|endoftext|>
|0| There you go, Gran.<|endoftext|>
|0| Did you put it in early enough?<|endoftext|>
|0| Dad, I put it in when you phoned me.<|endoftext|>
|0| I emailed you some instructions.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, you certainly did.<|endoftext|>
|0| Whoops!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, I so need you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Clara!<|endoftext|>
|0| No, stop, stop, don't move. Don't do anything.<|endoftext|>
|1| Why? What is it? What's wrong?<|endoftext|>
|0| You're naked.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, I am naked. I wondered if you'd notice.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, why are you naked?<|endoftext|>
|1| Because I'm going to church.<|endoftext|>
|1| Better?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, that was quick.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hologram clothes, projected directly onto your visual cortex.<|endoftext|>
|0| So you're still naked underneath?<|endoftext|>
|1| Everybody's naked underneath.<|endoftext|>
|0| Urgh, don't say things like that. It's Christmas. Come and meetmy family.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello, so, er, here he is.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hello, the Oswalds. Hello! Merry Christmas. Hello, hello.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hello, handsome. Anyone for Twister?<|endoftext|>
|0| So, this is the Doctor. My boyfriend. Isn't anyone going to sayhello?<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello.<|endoftext|>
|1| Excuse me a moment. Listen, I've got an idea to break the ice.Why don't I project my clothes hologram onto their visual cortexes too?<|endoftext|>
|0| So, to be clear, no one except me can see your clothes?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, and I'm starting to think it may be causing tension.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are we playing Twister now?<|endoftext|>
|0| Get in the kitchen.<|endoftext|>
|1| Eh? Sorry.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry. He's Swedish.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, please.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, that's never going to work, is it?<|endoftext|>
|0| What's wrong? Do you think it's not done yet?<|endoftext|>
|1| I think a decent vet would give it an even chance.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay. Well, use an app.<|endoftext|>
|1| An app?<|endoftext|>
|0| On your screwdriver. App it.<|endoftext|>
|1| Most certainly not. It doesn't do turkey. Nothing does turkey.You'd need a time machine. What?<|endoftext|>
|1| You can't keep using the Tardis like this.<|endoftext|>
|0| Like what?<|endoftext|>
|1| Missed birthdays, restaurant bookings. And please, just learnhow to use iPlayer.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ooo, vortex cooking?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yep, exposure to the time winds. It'll either come up a treat,or just possibly lay some eggs.<|endoftext|>
|0| Information available.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's that?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, just a bit of a Cyberman. He'll get us to the church ontime.<|endoftext|>
|0| I have developed a fault.<|endoftext|>
|1| The organics are all gone, but there's still a full set of databanks. Found it at the Maldovar market.<|endoftext|>
|0| Planet identified from analysis of message.<|endoftext|>
|1| Right, cool. Go on then. Okay, tell us, what is the planet? Goon.<|endoftext|>
|0| Processing official designation. Processing.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay, in your own time, dear. Don't rush.<|endoftext|>
|0| So why haven't you just gone down there and had a look?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's shielded. Even the Tardis can't break through it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Gallifrey.<|endoftext|>
|1| What did you say?<|endoftext|>
|0| Gallifrey.<|endoftext|>
|1| What are you talking about? Gallifrey? What do you mean?<|endoftext|>
|0| Confirmed. Planet designation, Gallifrey.<|endoftext|>
|1| You see that? Gallifrey is my home. I know it when I see it.That is not Gallifrey.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, are you okay.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's not Gallifrey. Gallifrey is gone.<|endoftext|>
|0| Unless, unless you saved it. You thought you might have.<|endoftext|>
|1| Even if it survived, it's gone from this universe. That is notmy home.<|endoftext|>
|1| It can't be.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's that?<|endoftext|>
|1| Papal Mainframe. It's like a great big flying church. The firstship to arrive. They are the ones who shielded the planet. They can getus down there.<|endoftext|>
|0| A friend of yours?<|endoftext|>
|1| Tasha Lem, the Mother Superious.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, she's inviting us aboard.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why?<|endoftext|>
|1| Because I asked her. Swallow this.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is it?<|endoftext|>
|1| Your hologram projector. You can't go to church with yourclothes on.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't feel like I'm wearing anything.<|endoftext|>
|1| I know. Relaxing, isn't it?<|endoftext|>
|0| What is this place?<|endoftext|>
|1| The Church of the Papal Mainframe, security hub of the knownuniverse.<|endoftext|>
|0| A security church?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yep. Keeping you safe in this world and the next. I veneratethe exaltation of the Mother Superious.<|endoftext|>
|0| Welcome to the Church of the Papal Mainframe. Your nudity isappreciated.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hey, babes.<|endoftext|>
|1| Loving the frock.<|endoftext|>
|0| Is that a new body? Give us a twirl.<|endoftext|>
|1| Tash, this old thing? Please, I've been rocking it forcenturies.<|endoftext|>
|0| Nice though. Tight.<|endoftext|>
|0| So, er, hello. Also here.<|endoftext|>
|1| Clara, this is Tasha Lem, the Head of the Church of the PapalMainframe. Tash, ho, ho, ho, ho. This is my, my associate, ClaraOswald. Miss Clara Oswald.<|endoftext|>
|0| We'll go to my chapel. All honours in place, no sacrificesrequired.<|endoftext|>
|1| It was Tasha who shielded the planet. Butyou could sneak me down there, couldn't you, Tash?<|endoftext|>
|0| I would have conditions. (to Clara) I have confidential mattersto discuss with the Doctor. Would you excuse us?<|endoftext|>
|1| Anything you have to say to me, you can say in front of Clara.Well, quite a lot of it. Probably about half. Maybe a smidge under.Actually, Clara, would you mind waiting out here, please?<|endoftext|>
|0| No worries. You two get yourselves a room.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, quite. No, stop it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Boss of the psycho space nuns. So you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|1| That altar looks like a bed.<|endoftext|>
|0| That bed looks like an altar.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yep.<|endoftext|>
|0| That message is transmitting through all of space and time. Whatdid it make you feel?<|endoftext|>
|1| Feel?<|endoftext|>
|0| Every sentient being in the universe who detected that signalfelt something. Something overpowering.<|endoftext|>
|1| What?<|endoftext|>
|0| Fear. Pure, unadulterated dread.<|endoftext|>
|0| I saw you and then I forgot you. How does that work?<|endoftext|>
|1| Right. What's the signal? Where's it comingfrom?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's a settlement. Human colony, level two. A farm, basically.<|endoftext|>
|1| Right. Anyone been for a look?<|endoftext|>
|0| Any one ship lands, the rest will follow. There will bebloodshed. Fortunately we got here first, shielded the planet. Wemaintain the truce by blocking all of them.<|endoftext|>
|1| Daleks, Cybermen, one of that lot, could break through yourdefences.<|endoftext|>
|0| Perhaps. But they're afraid, remember? Nobody wants to go first.<|endoftext|>
|1| I do.<|endoftext|>
|0| I was counting on it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Confess.<|endoftext|>
|0| Confess.<|endoftext|>
|0| What are you? Why do I keep forgetting you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Confess. Confess.<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|1| Are you okay?<|endoftext|>
|0| Fine. Yeah, fine. Sorry.<|endoftext|>
|0| Right. This is my personal teleport. I can put you down justoutside the town. Find the source of the message and report back to mein one hour. And on your life, Doctor, you will cause no trouble downthere.<|endoftext|>
|1| When do I? Don't answer that.<|endoftext|>
|1| What?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm not an idiot. Everyone in this church is trained to seestraight through holograms.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ah. Great.<|endoftext|>
|0| Give now. You are taking no technology of any kind down there.<|endoftext|>
|1| What can I do with a key? You, in, now.<|endoftext|>
|0| You could summon your Tardis.<|endoftext|>
|1| The Tardis doesn't work by remote. Fine. If it makes you feelany better, there we are.<|endoftext|>
|0| Remember. I want you back in one hour.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, cold. Very cold.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay, don't worry. There's a heat loss filter in your hologramshell. It'll kick in, just give it a moment. So, sweet little towncovered in snow, half the universe in terror. Why? Why?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, my God!<|endoftext|>
|1| What?<|endoftext|>
|0| There's something under the snow. It's<|endoftext|>
|1| What is it?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's cold.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay, just stand back please, Clara.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's stone. It's just stone. It's only a statue.<|endoftext|>
|1| Clara, step away from it!<|endoftext|>
|1| Clara, keep looking at it. Don't look away. Don't even blink!<|endoftext|>
|0| What is it?<|endoftext|>
|1| There is a Weeping Angel under the snow. It looks like astatue, isn't a statue. Can you get your foot out?<|endoftext|>
|0| Only if I get it out of my shoe.<|endoftext|>
|1| You're not wearing a shoe.<|endoftext|>
|0| Good point.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay, pull hard. One, two, three!<|endoftext|>
|0| They're climbing out of the snow. Oh, God!<|endoftext|>
|1| Keep looking at the. At all of them.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why?<|endoftext|>
|1| Quantum locked lifeform. It can only move if it's unobserved.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is it doing here?<|endoftext|>
|1| Same as everybody else. Must've got past Tasha's shield.<|endoftext|>
|1| Keep looking!<|endoftext|>
|0| I can't. I can't see. The snow's in my eyes.<|endoftext|>
|1| I just need to bring the Tardis down.<|endoftext|>
|0| You can't fly it remotely.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, but it can home in on the key.<|endoftext|>
|0| But she took your key!<|endoftext|>
|1| She took one of them.<|endoftext|>
|0| Engines activating.<|endoftext|>
|1| The old key in the quiff routine. Classic.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay, homing in on the mysterious message. Ooo yes, I likethat. The mysterious message.<|endoftext|>
|0| You've shaved your head?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yep. Clever plan to get us past the shield.<|endoftext|>
|0| You got bored one night, didn't you?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, tiny bit bored.<|endoftext|>
|0| Is that what happened to your eyebrows?<|endoftext|>
|1| No, they're just delicate. Right, setting us down near thesignal source. I'm going to turn the engines on silent. Don't want tomake a fuss.<|endoftext|>
|0| Put it back on.<|endoftext|>
|1| Why?<|endoftext|>
|0| Your ears are like rocket fins.<|endoftext|>
|1| I know.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, it's good to be wearing clothes again.That's so much better, don't you think?<|endoftext|>
|1| Now, what do we make of this place? It's two o'clock in theafternoon. Must be very short days here. The message is coming fromthat tower.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hello! Hello, there. Right, we're a couple from the next town.My name's probably Hank or Rock, something like that.<|endoftext|>
|0| Or Daisy?<|endoftext|>
|1| Shut up. Hello, good to meet you. Nice snow.<|endoftext|>
|0| Most pleasant to meet you too.<|endoftext|>
|0| Most pleasant. Most pleasant.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm the Doctor. I'm a Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey. Istole a time machine and ran away and I've been flouting the principallaw of my own people every since. That wasn't quite what I was meant tosay!<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm an English teacher from planet Earth, and I've run off witha man from space because I really fancy<|endoftext|>
|0| I think, perhaps, you should stop talking till you get used toit.<|endoftext|>
|1| Used to what?<|endoftext|>
|0| What did you say your name was?<|endoftext|>
|0| Bubbly personality masking bossy control freak.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm wearing a wig! No, ah, I see. Yes, of course. It's a truthfield. Oh, that is so quaint. I haven't seen a truth field in years.I'm wearing a wig.<|endoftext|>
|0| No one can lie in this town. Especially this close to thetower.<|endoftext|>
|1| Doesn't that make life a bit difficult?<|endoftext|>
|0| Not at all.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|1| This town, what's it called?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's Christmas.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's July.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, the town. The town is Christmas. That's what it's called.<|endoftext|>
|0| Be happy here. Be well.<|endoftext|>
|0| How can a town be called Christmas?<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't know. How can an island be called Easter? Maybe it'sjust nice here. I almost hate to find out what's wrong.<|endoftext|>
|1| There you are. What took you so long?<|endoftext|>
|0| What's wrong? It's only a crack in the wall.<|endoftext|>
|1| I knew. I always knew it wasn't over.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is it?<|endoftext|>
|1| A split in the skin of reality.<|endoftext|>
|1| A tiny sliver of the 26th of June, 2010. The day the universeblew up.<|endoftext|>
|0| Missed that.<|endoftext|>
|1| I rebooted it, put it all back together.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's good.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, it was my Tardis that blew it up in the first place. Ifelt a degree of responsibility. But the scar tissue remains. Astructural weakness in the whole universe. Whoa! And someone's tryingto get through it from outside our universe, from somewhere else. Ofcourse. Of course. It makes sense.<|endoftext|>
|0| It does?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes. If you were trying to break through a wall, you'd choosethe weakest spot. If you were trying to break into this universe, you'dchoose this crack, because. No. If you were trying to break back intothis universe. (to Handles) You said Gallifrey. Why did you sayGallifrey?<|endoftext|>
|0| Analysis of message composition indicates Gallifreyan origin,according to Tardis databanks.<|endoftext|>
|0| You said Gallifrey was gone.<|endoftext|>
|1| No. I said it was in another universe. The message is comingthrough here. The truth field is too, at a guess. If it's the TimeLords.If it's the Time Lords.<|endoftext|>
|1| Seal of the High Council of Gallifrey. Nicked it off the Masterin the Death Zone. (Five Doctors) There is an algorithm imprinted inthe atomic structure. Use it to decode the message.<|endoftext|>
|0| Message decoding. Message analysis proceeding. Informationavailable. The message is a request for information.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's a question. Why can't you just say it's a question?<|endoftext|>
|0| It is being projected through all of time and space on arepeating cycle.<|endoftext|>
|1| The oldest question in the universe, hidden in plain sight.<|endoftext|>
|0| Warning. Translation will be available to all lifeforms inrange. Translation follows. Doctor who? (slightly different voice eachtime.) Doctor who? Doctor who? Doctor who? Doctor who? Doctor who?Doctor who?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor who? Doctor who?<|endoftext|>
|0| Patch me through to the Doctor. Now!<|endoftext|>
|1| A question only I could answer. A truthfield to make sure I'm not lying. If I give my name, they'll knowthey've found the right place and that it's safe to come through.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Time Lords? Okay, so what then? If you answer the questionand they come back, what happens?<|endoftext|>
|1| Er, you need to take this to the Tardis and put it in thecharger slot for the sonic.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why?<|endoftext|>
|1| Hell. All hell, that's what happens if the Time Lords comeback. There's half a universe up there already, waiting to open fire.Now please, go to the Tardis and just do as I say.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Speak with me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor! Face me now!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|1| Mother Superious, there is only one thing I need from you. Thisplanet, what's it called?<|endoftext|>
|0| Trenzalore.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, is that it? Are you doing a cleverthing?<|endoftext|>
|0| If you speak your name, the Time Lords willreturn.<|endoftext|>
|1| If they return, they will come in peace.<|endoftext|>
|0| It doesn't matter. They will be met with a war that will neverend. The Time War will begin anew. You know that, Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Done.<|endoftext|>
|0| No. Don't you dare. No, no!<|endoftext|>
|1| They're asking for my help!<|endoftext|>
|0| And if you give it, war will be the consequence. I will not letthat happen, at any cost. Speak your name and this world will burn.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, this planet is protected.<|endoftext|>
|1| So, you lot, a quick word, thank you. Spot of news. Christmashas a new sheriff. Hello, everyone. I'm the Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Attention. Attention all Chapels and Choirsof the Papal Mainframe. The siege of Trenzalore is now begun. Therewill now be an unscheduled faith change. From this moment on, Idedicate this church to one cause. Silence. The Doctor will not speakhis name, and war will not begin. Silence will fall!<|endoftext|>
|0| Silence will fall! Silence will fall.<|endoftext|>
|0| In the time that followed, the PapalMainframe strove to maintain the peace between the Doctor and hisenemies.<|endoftext|>
|0| We remain undetectable to the Papal Mainframe.<|endoftext|>
|0| Commander Skarr. That's the detection warning. Ourinvisibility cloak is compromised.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's wrong with it?<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't know. I can't see it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, it looks invisible to me.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Church of the Papal Mainframe apologises for yourdeath. The relevant afterlives have been notified.<|endoftext|>
|0| As the days passed, and the years, theDoctor stayed true to his word. On the fields of Trenzalore, he stoodas protector both of his own people and his new home.<|endoftext|>
|0| Over the years, his foes would findnew, stranger ways to enter the town called Christmas.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you there? Hello? Am I getting warm?<|endoftext|>
|0| There's another one!<|endoftext|>
|0| There's another one! There's another one!<|endoftext|>
|0| There's another one! Doctor, Doctor! There's another one!<|endoftext|>
|0| Incinerate. Incinerate.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Doctor is required.<|endoftext|>
|1| There you go, Barnable.<|endoftext|>
|0| Thanks.<|endoftext|>
|1| Working fine. Nice action. Don't leave it out in the rain again.<|endoftext|>
|1| Fixed the wheels and the antigrav.<|endoftext|>
|0| The anti what?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, may have gone a bit far. Now then, what do we have today?Don't you move one step further. Wooden Cyberman. Nice. Like it.<|endoftext|>
|1| Low tech, doesn't set off the alarms upstairs.<|endoftext|>
|1| Only bit of tech allowed in. Got in before the truce. Now, Ijust sent an instruction to your firearm to reverse the polarity andfire out the back end. Now, as we're standing in a truth field, youwill understand I cannot be lying. If you like, you can scan myscrewdriver, verify that's the signal I sent.<|endoftext|>
|0| Signal verified.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes. I probably should have mentioned this doesn't work onwood. You send your friends up there a message from the Doctor. Youtell them the Doctor stays.<|endoftext|>
|1| Next.<|endoftext|>
|0| With every victory, the town celebrated.<|endoftext|>
|1| And there's me arm-wrestling a Draconian. I remember that.<|endoftext|>
|0| In time, the Doctor seemed to forget he'd lived any otherlife.<|endoftext|>
|1| Christmas is defended.<|endoftext|>
|0| And the people of the town came to love the man who stayedfor Christmas.<|endoftext|>
|1| You've got to be the drunk giraffe. You've got to commit! Don'tbe cool, guys. Cool is not cool.<|endoftext|>
|0| Cool is not cool!<|endoftext|>
|1| And what's the dance we're doing?<|endoftext|>
|0| The drunk giraffe!<|endoftext|>
|1| The drunk giraffe. Yeah, it is. Merry Christmas. Give me a hug.Bring it in.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah!<|endoftext|>
|1| How's your father's barn?<|endoftext|>
|0| You've fixed the leak all right, but he says it's bigger onthe inside now.<|endoftext|>
|1| Shush, they'll all want one.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is it? What's that noise.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well. Where have you been for three hundred years? Ha!<|endoftext|>
|0| What's that?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's my ship.<|endoftext|>
|0| Your what?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's my Tardis. That's how I got here in the first place.<|endoftext|>
|0| Does this mean you're leaving?<|endoftext|>
|1| What are you doing here?<|endoftext|>
|0| I was in space.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, you were in the time vortex. She must have extended theforce field. No wonder. No wonder she's late, dragging you around.<|endoftext|>
|0| You tricked me.<|endoftext|>
|1| I saved you.<|endoftext|>
|0| You didn't even say goodbye!<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm furious with you!<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, I am not even talking to you!<|endoftext|>
|0| Ha.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, Doctor. Fixing toys and fighting monsters.<|endoftext|>
|1| The turkey isn't done yet.<|endoftext|>
|0| Is it still asking the question?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, never stops. Come upstairs. It's almost time.<|endoftext|>
|0| What for?<|endoftext|>
|1| Dawn. The light here lasts only a few minutes. You don't wantto miss it.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, it's a standoff. They can't attack in case I unleash theTime Lords, and I can't run away, because they'll burn this planet tostop the Time Lords. Hey, after all these years, I've finally foundsomewhere that needs me to stick around. A town called Christmas.Could've been worse. Right, there you go, buddy. Comfy?<|endoftext|>
|0| Comfort is irrelevant.<|endoftext|>
|1| How's that, is that better?<|endoftext|>
|0| Affirmative.<|endoftext|>
|1| You just take it easy, buddy. He's getting old. I do my bestfor him, but I just can't get the parts, you know. Hey, I know thefeeling.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where did you get those?<|endoftext|>
|1| I have a supplier. The pink ones are best.<|endoftext|>
|0| I have developed a fault.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hey, don't you worry, Handles. you're just dreaming. The sun'scoming up very soon. You just hang on in there.<|endoftext|>
|0| I have developed a fault. I, I have developed a fault.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hey, Handles. Come on. Come on. One more dawn, you can do it.You've got it in you. Come on, just hang on in there.<|endoftext|>
|0| Attention. Emergency. Attention.<|endoftext|>
|1| Handles, what is it? What's wrong?<|endoftext|>
|0| Urgent action required. You must patch the telephone deviceback through the console unit.<|endoftext|>
|1| Come back. Handles? Handles. Oh. Thank you, Handles, and welldone. Well done, mate.<|endoftext|>
|1| What do you think of my new place? I come up here once a dayfor a few minutes, to remind myself of what it is I'm protecting.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's beautiful. Why did you send me away?<|endoftext|>
|1| Because if I hadn't, I'd have buried you a long time ago.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, you wouldn't. I would never have let you get stuck here.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ha! Everyone gets stuck somewhere eventually, Clara. Everythingends.<|endoftext|>
|0| Except you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Have you been paying attention? I'm an old man now.<|endoftext|>
|0| But you don't die. You change. You pop right back up with a newface.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, not for ever. I can change twelve times. Thirteen versionsof me. Thirteen silly Doctors.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, so you're number eleven, so<|endoftext|>
|1| Ha. Are we forgetting Captain Grumpy, eh? I didn't call myselfthe Doctor during the Time War, but it was still a regeneration.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, so you're number twelve.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, number ten once regenerated and kept the same face. I hadvanity issues at the time. Twelve regenerations, Clara. I can't ever doit again. This is where I end up. This face, this version of me. We sawthis planet in the future, remember? All those graves, one of themmine.<|endoftext|>
|0| Change the future.<|endoftext|>
|1| I can't.<|endoftext|>
|0| You've got your Tardis back.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ha! You think I'm just going to fly away, abandon everyone?<|endoftext|>
|0| Of course not. But you've been protecting this town for overthree hundred years. Do you not think it's anybody else's go yet?<|endoftext|>
|1| There is no one else to protect it.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's not going to be you for ever. It'll end the same way,whatever you do.<|endoftext|>
|1| Every life I save is a victory. Every single one.<|endoftext|>
|0| What about your life? Just for once, after all this time, haveyou not earned the right to think about that? Sorry. Wrong thing tosay. We shouldn't be having an argument.<|endoftext|>
|1| Clara, I've been having that argument for the last threehundred years, all by myself.<|endoftext|>
|0| But you didn't have your Tardis.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah. Yes, well, that made it easier to stay. True.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah. Look who's woken up.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Church of the Silence requests parlay. Your rights andsafety are sanctified.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'll be right up.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm sending a transporter.<|endoftext|>
|1| Nah, don't bother. I've got me motor back.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's gone dark.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, well, the sun's gone down.<|endoftext|>
|0| Already?<|endoftext|>
|1| Everything ends, Clara. And sooner than you think.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hmm. Are you guarding my Tardis, Barnable?<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you coming back?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, come on. You know me.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'll wait.<|endoftext|>
|0| She hasn't aged much.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, she's against ageing.<|endoftext|>
|0| Approach.<|endoftext|>
|0| Confess.<|endoftext|>
|0| What are those things?<|endoftext|>
|0| Confess.<|endoftext|>
|1| Confessional priests. Very popular. Genetically engineered soyou forget everything you told them.<|endoftext|>
|0| Told who?<|endoftext|>
|1| There you go.<|endoftext|>
|0| Satisfactory?<|endoftext|>
|1| Where are the pink ones?<|endoftext|>
|0| E numbers. You're hyper enough as it is.<|endoftext|>
|0| So, this is sweet. Middle of a siege and you two have littlechats?<|endoftext|>
|0| She's right. This situation cannot continue.<|endoftext|>
|1| It can't end, either.<|endoftext|>
|0| Report.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Time Lord has entered the trap.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why did you ever come to Trenzalore?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, I did come to Trenzalore, and nothing can change thatnow. Didn't stop you trying though, did it?<|endoftext|>
|0| Not me. The Kovarian Chapter broke away. They travelled backalong your timeline and tried to prevent you ever reaching Trenzalore.<|endoftext|>
|1| So that's who blew up my Tardis. I thought I'd left the bathrunning.<|endoftext|>
|0| They blew up your time capsule, created the very cracks in theuniverse through which the Time Lords are now calling.<|endoftext|>
|1| The destiny trap. You can't change history if you're part ofit.<|endoftext|>
|0| They engineered a psychopath to kill you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Totally married her. I'd never have made it here alive withoutRiver Song.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm not interested in changing history, Doctor. I want to changethe future. The Daleks send for reinforcements daily. They are massingfor war. Three days ago, they attacked the Mainframe itself.<|endoftext|>
|1| They attacked here?<|endoftext|>
|0| How did you stop them?<|endoftext|>
|0| Stop them? It was slaughter.<|endoftext|>
|1| Why didn't you call me? I could have helped.<|endoftext|>
|0| I tried. I died in this room, screaming your name.<|endoftext|>
|1| No.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh. I died. It's funny the things that slip your mind. Ah!<|endoftext|>
|1| No! No, no, no. Tasha, no, please, not Tasha. No. Fight it.Tash, fight it!<|endoftext|>
|0| Step away from the Dalek unit, Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| You shouldn't even know who I am.<|endoftext|>
|0| Information concerning the Doctor was harvested from the cadaverof Tasha Lem.<|endoftext|>
|1| Bet she never told you how to break through the Trenzaloreforcefield, though. She'd have died first.<|endoftext|>
|0| Several times.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, you'd better kill me, then. Go on. But before you do<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor who? Doctor who? Doctor who?<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm a tough old bird. I'll be ages dying. Way enough time toanswer a question. And, oh dear, what happens then, boys?<|endoftext|>
|0| You will die in silence, Doctor, or your associate will die.<|endoftext|>
|1| Fine, go on, kill her. Kill her! See if I care. But tell me,what you are going to do next?<|endoftext|>
|0| See how the Time Lord betrays.<|endoftext|>
|0| You'll kill me anyway. What difference does it make? I'm notafraid. I'll leave that to you.<|endoftext|>
|1| You see, Tasha, that's what I'm talking about. That is a woman!I always knew you were a bit spineless, you and your pointless church.Why did I ever rely on you? Never trust a nun to do a Doctor's work.<|endoftext|>
|1| And she's back!<|endoftext|>
|1| You never could resist a row.<|endoftext|>
|0| Kiss me when I ask.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, you'd better ask nicely.<|endoftext|>
|0| In your dreams.<|endoftext|>
|1| Right, get us back to the Tardis. Can you do that?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, but quickly, the Dalek inside me is waking.<|endoftext|>
|1| Fight it.<|endoftext|>
|0| I can't.<|endoftext|>
|1| Listen to me. You have been fighting the psychopath inside youall your life. Shut up and win. That is an order, Tasha Lem.<|endoftext|>
|0| The forcefield will hold for a while, but it will decay, andthere are breaches already.<|endoftext|>
|1| Then this isn't a siege any more, it's a war. It's all up toyou now. Fight the Daleks, inside and out. You can do it, I know youcan.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, I see. You've got your Tardis back, haven't you? Time to flyaway.<|endoftext|>
|1| Tasha, please. Please. Thank you.<|endoftext|>
|0| None of this was for you, you fatuous egotist. It was for thepeace. Fly away, Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|1| It's done.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is?<|endoftext|>
|1| Your turkey. Either that or its woken up.<|endoftext|>
|0| Do you want some?<|endoftext|>
|1| Go on, then.<|endoftext|>
|0| Got any plates?<|endoftext|>
|1| Do you know, I've even got Christmas crackers.<|endoftext|>
|0| One thing. Give me those big sad eyes, look at me so I knowyou're not lying, and tell me you will never send me away ever again.<|endoftext|>
|1| Clara Oswald, I will never send you away again.<|endoftext|>
|0| Turkey smells good!<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, smells great.<|endoftext|>
|0| Perfect.<|endoftext|>
|0| Merry Christmas.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|0| If you're not leaving, why did you bringit back?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's a reminder. Besides, I might leave tomorrow. Or the nextday. Or the day after that.<|endoftext|>
|0| And so, to the fields of Trenzalore came all the TimeLord's enemies. For this was the winter of the Doctor. In time, whenall other races had retreated or burned, only the Church of theMainframe remained in the path of the Daleks. And so those ancientenemies, the Doctor and the Silence, stood back to back on the fieldsof Trenzalore.<|endoftext|>
|0| Merry Christmas, everyone. Merry Christmas, everyone.<|endoftext|>
|0| Other fish in the sea, that's what I'm saying.<|endoftext|>
|0| Linda, I don't think Clara wants to talk about it.<|endoftext|>
|0| I've got a suggestion, that's all. I've got a list ofsuggestions.<|endoftext|>
|0| Linda.<|endoftext|>
|0| You could make a boy band out of my list.<|endoftext|>
|0| I hate boy bands.<|endoftext|>
|0| Of course you don't, not at your age.<|endoftext|>
|0| These crackers are rubbish.<|endoftext|>
|0| I bought them.<|endoftext|>
|0| I know.<|endoftext|>
|0| They're classy.<|endoftext|>
|0| They don't have jokes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Exactly.<|endoftext|>
|0| They've got poems.<|endoftext|>
|0| They're more dramatic crackers.<|endoftext|>
|0| I like the jokes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Tell us a joke, Gran. You know loads of jokes.<|endoftext|>
|0| I think we're probably talking about my list now.<|endoftext|>
|0| Probably not.<|endoftext|>
|0| Tell us how you met Dad. The thing about the pigeon.<|endoftext|>
|0| I saw him on a pier on a rainy day.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, no, not that one. The one about the pigeon.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'd seen him before, lots of times, but he just looked sobeautiful standing there.<|endoftext|>
|0| The pigeon in the restaurant. You remember?<|endoftext|>
|0| I wanted everything to stop. I wanted nothing to change everagain.<|endoftext|>
|0| If he could just keep standing there, so beautiful. A long timeago. Don't hug me so tight, dear. You'll break something.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, that's nice. Crying at Christmas.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry.<|endoftext|>
|0| I hope you made a wish.<|endoftext|>
|0| Clara? What's wrong, Clara.<|endoftext|>
|0| Everybody just stay put.<|endoftext|>
|0| You can fly the Tardis?<|endoftext|>
|0| Flying the Tardis was always easy. It was flying the Doctor Inever quite mastered.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's happened to him?<|endoftext|>
|0| What am I supposed to do?<|endoftext|>
|0| He shouldn't die alone. Go to him.<|endoftext|>
|1| Barnable?<|endoftext|>
|0| Clara.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello, Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| Were you always so young?<|endoftext|>
|0| Nah, that was you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah.<|endoftext|>
|0| Seek the Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Merry Christmas.<|endoftext|>
|1| Merry Christmas.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hey, it's okay. It's all right, don't worry.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah! Is there a joke? Ha?<|endoftext|>
|0| Extract from Thoughts on a Clock by Eric Ritchie junior.<|endoftext|>
|1| Is it a knock knock one? Those are best.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't think so.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, read it. Go on.<|endoftext|>
|0| And now it's time for one last bow, like all your other selves.Eleven's hour is over now. The clock is striking twelve's.<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't get it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor! The Doctor will be brought!<|endoftext|>
|0| The Daleks demand the Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| They're here. The Daleks, we can't stop them. They want you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, all right, Barnable. Are you Barnable?<|endoftext|>
|0| No, Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's okay, Barnable, don't worry. I have got a plan. Off youpop.<|endoftext|>
|1| I haven't got a plan, but people love it when I say that.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, what are you going to do?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, I don't know. Talk very fast, hope something good happens,take the credit. That's generally how it works.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor<|endoftext|>
|1| Not this time, though. This is it.<|endoftext|>
|0| No!<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes. We saw the future, Clara. This is how it ends.<|endoftext|>
|0| Change it.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ha.<|endoftext|>
|0| Like Tasha said, change the future.<|endoftext|>
|1| I could have once, when there were Time Lords. Not any more.<|endoftext|>
|0| Locate the Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| No. You're going to stay here. Promise meyou will.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why?<|endoftext|>
|1| I'll be keeping you safe. One last victory. Allow me that. Giveme that, my impossible girl. Thank you. And goodbye.<|endoftext|>
|1| The trouble with Daleks is, they take so long to say anything.Probably die of boredom before they shoot me.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Doctor is required!<|endoftext|>
|0| Listen to me, you lot. Listen! Help him. Help him change thefuture. Do it. Do something.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|0| You've been asking a question, and it's time someone told youyou've been getting it wrong. His name, his name is the Doctor. All thename he needs. Everything you need to know about him. And if you lovehim, and you should, help him. Help him.<|endoftext|>
|1| Sorry I'm a bit slow. I may not be at mybest right now.<|endoftext|>
|0| You are dying, Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, I'm dying. You've been trying to kill me for centuries,and here I am, dying of old age. If you want something done, do ityourself.<|endoftext|>
|0| You will die, and the Time Lords will never return.<|endoftext|>
|1| You still can't work up the courage to shoot me, can you?You're still worried I've got something up my sleeve. Well, you knockyourselves out, boys. I've got nothing this time.<|endoftext|>
|0| You will die now, Doctor. This is the end of you.<|endoftext|>
|0| The rules of regeneration are known. You have expended allyour lives.<|endoftext|>
|1| Sorry, what did you say? Did you mention the rules? Now,listen. Bit of advice. Tell me the truth if you think you know it. Laydown the law if you're feeling brave. But, Daleks, never, ever tell methe rules!<|endoftext|>
|0| Emergency! Emergency! The Doctor is regenerating!<|endoftext|>
|0| The Doctor is regenerating!<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, look at this. Regeneration number thirteen. We're breakingsome serious science here, boys. I tell you what, it's going to be awhopper!<|endoftext|>
|0| Exterminate! Exterminate the Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| You think you can stop me now, Daleks? If you want my life, ha,ha, come and get it!<|endoftext|>
|0| Get inside! Come on, quickly. Get inside,quick.<|endoftext|>
|1| Love from Gallifrey, boys!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|1| Hello.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're young again. You're okay. You didn't even change yourface.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ha! It's started. I can't stop it now. This is just the reset.A whole new regeneration cycle. Ooo.<|endoftext|>
|1| Taking a bit longer. Just breaking it in. Oh. Oh. Gah.<|endoftext|>
|1| It all just disappears, doesn't it? Everything you are, gone ina moment, like breath on a mirror. Any moment now, he's a-coming.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who's coming?<|endoftext|>
|1| The Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| But you, you are the Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yep, and I always will be.<|endoftext|>
|1| But times change, and so must I.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amelia?<|endoftext|>
|0| Who's Amelia?<|endoftext|>
|1| The first face this face saw. We all change, when you thinkabout it. We're all different people all through our lives. And that'sokay, that's good, you've got to keep moving, so long as you rememberall the people that you used to be. I will not forget one line of this.Not one day. I swear. I will always remember when the Doctor was me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Raggedy man. Good night.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, no.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hey<|endoftext|>
|0| Please don't change.<|endoftext|>
|1| Kidneys! I've got new kidneys. I don't like the colour.<|endoftext|>
|0| Of your kidneys?<|endoftext|>
|0| What's happening?<|endoftext|>
|1| We're probably crashing. Oh!<|endoftext|>
|0| Into what?<|endoftext|>
