|0| Dear Santa. Thank you for the dolls and pencils and the fish.It's Easter now, so I hope I didn't wake you, but honest, it is anemergency. There's a crack in my wall. Aunt Sharon says it's just anordinary crack, but I know it's not, because at night there's voices,so please, please, could you send someone to fix it? Or a policeman. Ora<|endoftext|>
|0| Back in a moment.<|endoftext|>
|0| Thank you, Santa.<|endoftext|>
|1| Could I have an apple? All I can think about. Apples. I loveapples. Maybe I'm having a craving? That's new. Never had cravingsbefore.<|endoftext|>
|1| Whoa. Look at that.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you okay?<|endoftext|>
|1| Just had a fall. All the way down there, right to the library.Hell of a climb back up.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're soaking wet.<|endoftext|>
|1| I was in the swimming pool.<|endoftext|>
|0| You said you were in the library.<|endoftext|>
|1| So was the swimming pool.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you a policeman?<|endoftext|>
|1| Why? Did you call a policeman?<|endoftext|>
|0| Did you come about the crack in my wall?<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you all right, mister?<|endoftext|>
|1| No, I'm fine. It's okay. This is all perfectly norm<|endoftext|>
|0| Who are you?<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't know yet. I'm still cooking. Does it scare you?<|endoftext|>
|0| No, it just looks a bit weird.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, no, no. The crack in your wall. Does it scare you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well then, no time to lose. I'm the Doctor. Do everything Itell you, don't ask stupid questions, and don't wander off.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you all right?<|endoftext|>
|1| Early days. Steering's a bit off.<|endoftext|>
|0| If you're a doctor, why does your box sayPolice?<|endoftext|>
|1| That's disgusting. What is that?<|endoftext|>
|0| An apple.<|endoftext|>
|1| Apple's rubbish. I hate apples.<|endoftext|>
|0| You said you loved them.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, no, no. I like yoghurt. Yoghurt's my favourite. Give meyoghurt.<|endoftext|>
|1| I hate yoghurt. It's just stuff with bits in.<|endoftext|>
|0| You said it was your favourite.<|endoftext|>
|1| New mouth. New rules. It's like eating after cleaning yourteeth. Everything tastes wrong. Argh!<|endoftext|>
|0| What is it? What's wrong with you?<|endoftext|>
|1| Wrong with me? It's not my fault. Why can't you give me anydecent food? You're Scottish. Fry something.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah, bacon!<|endoftext|>
|1| Bacon. That's bacon. Are you trying to poison me?<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah, you see? Beans.<|endoftext|>
|1| Beans are evil. Bad, bad beans. Bread and butter. Now you'retalking.<|endoftext|>
|1| And stay out!<|endoftext|>
|0| We've got some carrots.<|endoftext|>
|1| Carrots? Are you insane? No. Wait. Hang on. I know what I need.I need, I need, I need fish fingers and custard.<|endoftext|>
|0| Funny.<|endoftext|>
|1| Am I? Good. Funny's good. What's your name?<|endoftext|>
|0| Amelia Pond.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, that's a brilliant name. Amelia Pond. Like a name in afairy tale. Are we in Scotland, Amelia?<|endoftext|>
|0| No. We had to move to England. It's rubbish.<|endoftext|>
|1| So what about your mum and dad, then? Are they upstairs?Thought we'd have woken them by now.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't have a mum and dad. Just an aunt.<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't even have an aunt.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're lucky.<|endoftext|>
|1| I know. So, your aunt, where is she?<|endoftext|>
|0| She's out.<|endoftext|>
|1| And she left you all alone?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm not scared.<|endoftext|>
|1| Course, you're not. You're not scared of anything. Box fallsout of the sky, man falls out of a box, man eats fish custard, and lookat you, just sitting there. So you know what I think?<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|1| Must be a hell of a scary crack in your wall.<|endoftext|>
|1| You've had some cowboys in here. Not actual cowboys, thoughthat can happen.<|endoftext|>
|0| I used to hate apples, so my mum put faces on them.<|endoftext|>
|1| She sounds good, your mum. I'll keep it for later. This wall issolid and the crack doesn't go all the way through it. So here's athing. Where's the draught coming from?<|endoftext|>
|1| Wibbly-wobbly timey-wimey. You know what the crack is?<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's a crack. But I'll tell you something funny. If you knockedthis wall down, the crack would stay put, because the crack isn't inthe wall.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where is it then?<|endoftext|>
|1| Everywhere. In everything. It's a split in the skin of theworld. Two parts of space and time that should never have touched,pressed together right here in the wall of your bedroom. Sometimes, canyou hear?<|endoftext|>
|0| A voice. Yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Prisoner Zero has escaped.<|endoftext|>
|1| Prisoner Zero?<|endoftext|>
|0| Prisoner Zero has escaped. That's what I heard. What does itmean?<|endoftext|>
|0| Prisoner Zero has escaped.<|endoftext|>
|1| It means that on the other side of this wall, there's a prisonand they've lost a prisoner. And you know what that means?<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|1| You need a better wall. The only way to close the breach is toopen it all the way. The forces will invert and it'll snap itself shut.Or<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|1| You know when grown-ups tell you everything's going to be fineand you think they're probably lying to make you feel better?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|1| Everything's going to be fine.<|endoftext|>
|0| Prisoner Zero has escaped. Prisoner Zero has escaped.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hello? Hello?<|endoftext|>
|0| What's that?<|endoftext|>
|1| There, you see? Told you it would close. Good as new.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's that thing? Was that Prisoner Zero?<|endoftext|>
|1| No. I think that was Prisoner Zero's guard. Whatever it was, itsent me a message. Psychic paper. Takes a lovely little message.(reads) Prisoner Zero has escaped. But why tell us? Unless.<|endoftext|>
|0| Unless what?<|endoftext|>
|1| Unless Prisoner Zero escaped through here. But he couldn'thave. We'd know.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's difficult. Brand new me. Nothing works yet. But there'ssomething I'm missing. In the corner of my eye.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!<|endoftext|>
|1| I've got to get back in there. The enginesare phasing. It's going to burn!<|endoftext|>
|0| But it's just a box. How can a box have engines?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's not a box. It's a time machine.<|endoftext|>
|0| What, a real one? You've got a real time machine?<|endoftext|>
|1| Not for much longer if I can't get her stabilised. Five minutehop into the future should do it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Can I come?<|endoftext|>
|1| Not safe in here. Not yet. Five minutes. Give me five minutes,I'll be right back.<|endoftext|>
|0| People always say that.<|endoftext|>
|1| Am I people? Do I even look like people? Trust me. I'm theDoctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Geronimo!<|endoftext|>
|1| Amelia! Amelia, I worked out what it was. I know what I wasmissing! You've got to get out of there!<|endoftext|>
|1| Amelia? Amelia, are you all right? Are youthere?<|endoftext|>
|1| Prisoner Zero's here. Prisoner Zero is here! Prisoner Zero ishere! Do you understand me? Prisoner Zero is<|endoftext|>
|0| So. They all called out at once, that's what you're saying?All of them. All the coma patients. You do understand that these peopleare all comatose, don't you? They can't speak.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, Doctor Ramsden.<|endoftext|>
|0| Then why are you wasting my time?<|endoftext|>
|0| Because they called for you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor. Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor. Doctor<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor. Doctor. Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| White male, mid twenties, breaking and entering. Send me someback-up. I've got him restrained. Oi! You, sit still.<|endoftext|>
|1| Cricket bat. I'm getting cricket bat.<|endoftext|>
|0| You were breaking and entering.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, that's much better. Brand new me. Whack on the head, justwhat I needed.<|endoftext|>
|0| Do you want to shut up now? I've got back up on the way.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hang on, no, wait. You're a policewoman.<|endoftext|>
|0| And you're breaking and entering. You see how this works?<|endoftext|>
|1| But what are you doing here? Where's Amelia?<|endoftext|>
|0| Amelia Pond?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, Amelia. Little Scottish girl. Where is she? I promisedher five minutes but the engines were phasing. I suppose I must havegone a bit far. Has something happened to her?<|endoftext|>
|0| Amelia Pond hasn't lived here in a long time.<|endoftext|>
|1| How long?<|endoftext|>
|0| Six months.<|endoftext|>
|1| No. No. No. No, I can't be six months late. I said fiveminutes. I promised. What happened to her? What happened to AmeliaPond?<|endoftext|>
|0| (into radio) Sarge, it's me again. Hurry it up. This guy knowssomething about Amelia Pond.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't think they were even conscious.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor Ramsden, there is another sort of er, funny thing.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, I know. Doctor Carver told me about your conversation.We've been very patient with you, Rory. You're a good enough nurse, butfor God's sake.<|endoftext|>
|0| I've seen them.<|endoftext|>
|0| These patients are under twenty four hour supervision. We knowif their blood pressure changes. There is no possibility that you couldhave seen them wandering about the village. Why are you giving me yourphone?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's a camera too.<|endoftext|>
|0| You need to take some time off, Rory. A lot of time off. Startnow. Now.<|endoftext|>
|1| I need to speak to whoever lives in thishouse right now.<|endoftext|>
|0| I live here.<|endoftext|>
|1| But you're the police.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, and this is where I live. Have you got a problem with that?<|endoftext|>
|1| How many rooms?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm sorry, what?<|endoftext|>
|1| On this floor. How many rooms on this floor? Count them for menow.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why?<|endoftext|>
|1| Because it will change your life.<|endoftext|>
|0| Five. One, two, three, four, five.<|endoftext|>
|1| Six.<|endoftext|>
|0| Six?<|endoftext|>
|1| Look.<|endoftext|>
|0| Look where?<|endoftext|>
|0| That's, that is not possible. How's that possible?<|endoftext|>
|1| There's a perception filter all round the door. Sensed it thelast time I was here. Should've seen it.<|endoftext|>
|0| But that's a whole room. That's a whole room I've never evennoticed.<|endoftext|>
|1| The filter stops you noticing. Something came a while ago tohide. It's still hiding, and you need to uncuff me now.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't have the key. I lost it.<|endoftext|>
|1| How can you have lost it? Stay away from that door! Do nottouch that door! Listen to me, do not open that. Why does no-one everlisten to me? Do I just have a face that nobody listens to?<|endoftext|>
|1| Again. My screwdriver, where is it?<|endoftext|>
|0| Silver thing, blue at the end. Where did it go?<|endoftext|>
|0| There's nothing here.<|endoftext|>
|1| Whatever's there stopped you seeing the room.<|endoftext|>
|1| What makes you think you could see it?<|endoftext|>
|0| Now please, just get out.<|endoftext|>
|0| Silver, blue at the end?<|endoftext|>
|0| My screwdriver, yeah.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's here.<|endoftext|>
|1| Must have rolled under the door.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah. Must have. And then it must have jumpedup on the table.<|endoftext|>
|1| Get out of there.<|endoftext|>
|0| Get out of there! Get out!<|endoftext|>
|1| Get out of there!<|endoftext|>
|0| What is it? What are you doing?<|endoftext|>
|0| There's nothing here, but<|endoftext|>
|1| Corner of your eye.<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't try to see it. If it knows you've seen it, it willkill you. Don't look at it. Do not look.<|endoftext|>
|1| Get out!<|endoftext|>
|1| Give me that.<|endoftext|>
|1| Come on. What's the bad alien done to you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Will that door hold it?<|endoftext|>
|0| What's that? What's it doing?<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't know. Getting dressed? Run. Just go. Your back up'scoming. I'll be fine.<|endoftext|>
|0| There is no back up.<|endoftext|>
|1| I heard you on the radio. You called for back up.<|endoftext|>
|0| I was pretending. It's a pretend radio.<|endoftext|>
|1| You're a policewoman.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm a kissogram!<|endoftext|>
|0| But it's just<|endoftext|>
|1| No, it isn't. Look at the faces.<|endoftext|>
|0| What? I'm sorry, but what?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's all one creature. One creature disguised as two. Cleverold multi-form. A bit of a rush job, though. Got the voice a bitmuddled, did you? Mind you, where did you get the pattern from? You'dneed a psychic link, a live feed. How did you fix that?<|endoftext|>
|1| Stay, boy! Her and me, we're safe. Want to know why? She sentfor back up.<|endoftext|>
|0| I didn't send for back-up!<|endoftext|>
|1| I know. That was a clever lie to save our lives. Okay, yeah, noback up. And that's why we're safe. Alone, we're not a threat to you.If we had back up, you'd have to kill us.<|endoftext|>
|0| Attention, Prisoner Zero. The human residence issurrounded. Attention Prisoner Zero. The human residence is surrounded.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's that?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, that would be back up. Okay, one more time. We do haveback up and that's definitely why we're safe.<|endoftext|>
|0| Prisoner Zero will vacate the human residence or the humanresidence will be incinerated.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, safe apart from, you know, incineration.<|endoftext|>
|0| Prisoner Zero will vacate the human residence or the humanresidence will be incinerated.<|endoftext|>

|1| Kissogram?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, a kissogram. Work through it.<|endoftext|>
|1| Why'd you pretend to be a policewoman?<|endoftext|>
|0| You broke into my house. It was this or a French maid. What'sgoing on? Tell me. Tell me!<|endoftext|>
|1| An alien convict is hiding in your spare room disguised as aman and a dog, and some other aliens are about to incinerate yourhouse. Any questions?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|1| Me too. No, no, no, no! Don't do that, not now! It's stillrebuilding. Not letting us in.<|endoftext|>
|0| Prisoner Zero will vacate the human residence or the humanresidence will be incinerated.<|endoftext|>
|0| Come on.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, wait, hang on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. The shed. Idestroyed that shed last time I was here. Smashed it to pieces.<|endoftext|>
|0| So there's a new one. Let's go.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, but the new one's got old. It's ten years old at least.Twelve years. I'm not six months late, I'm twelve years late.<|endoftext|>
|0| He's coming.<|endoftext|>
|1| You said six months. Why did you say six months?<|endoftext|>
|0| We've got to go.<|endoftext|>
|1| This matters. This is important. Why did you say six months?<|endoftext|>
|0| Why did you say five minutes!<|endoftext|>
|1| What?<|endoftext|>
|0| Come on.<|endoftext|>
|1| What?<|endoftext|>

|0| What? There's a Prisoner Zero too?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|1| See, that ship up there is scanning this area fornon-terrestrial technology. And nothing says non-terrestrial like asonic screwdriver.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oi, come back here! Come back!<|endoftext|>
|1| I think someone's going to notice, don't you?<|endoftext|>
|1| No, no! No, don't do that!<|endoftext|>

|0| Doctor! The drain. It just sort of melted and went down the drain.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, of course it did.<|endoftext|>
|0| What do we do now?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's hiding in human form. We need to drive it into the open.No Tardis, no screwdriver, seventeen minutes. Come on, think. Think!<|endoftext|>
|0| Barney? Barney? Barney? Can you hear me, Barney? Barney?Barney?<|endoftext|>
|0| So that thing, that hid in my house for twelveyears?<|endoftext|>

|0| So how come you show up again on the same day that lot do? Thesame minute!<|endoftext|>
|1| They're looking for him, but they followed me. They saw methrough the crack, got a fix, they're only late because I am.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's he on about?<|endoftext|>
|1| Nurse boy, give me your phone.<|endoftext|>
|0| How can he be real? He was never real.<|endoftext|>
|1| Phone. Now. Give me.<|endoftext|>
|0| He was just a game. We were kids. You made me dress up as him.<|endoftext|>
|1| These photos, they're are all coma patients?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, they're all the multiform. Eight comas, eight disguises forPrisoner Zero.<|endoftext|>
|0| He had a dog, though. There's a dog in a coma?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, the coma patient dreams he's walking a dog, Prisoner Zerogets a dog. Laptop! Your friend, what was his name? Not him, thegood-looking one.<|endoftext|>
|0| Thanks.<|endoftext|>
|0| Jeff.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, thanks.<|endoftext|>
|1| He had a laptop in his bag. A laptop. Big bag, big laptop. Ineed Jeff's laptop. You two, get to the hospital. Get everyone out ofthat ward. Clear the whole floor. Phone me when you're done.<|endoftext|>
|0| Your car. Come on.<|endoftext|>
|0| But how can he be here? How can the Doctor be here?<|endoftext|>
|1| Hello. Laptop. Give me.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, no, no, no, wait.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's fine. Give it here.<|endoftext|>

|0| Gran.<|endoftext|>
|0| What are you doing?<|endoftext|>
|1| The sun's gone wibbly, so right now, somewhere out there,there's going to be a big old video conference call. All the experts inthe world panicking at once, and do you know what they need? Me. Ah,and here they all are. All the big boys. NASA, Jodrell Bank, TokyoSpace Centre, Patrick Moore.<|endoftext|>
|0| I like Patrick Moore.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'll get you his number. But watch him, he's a devil.<|endoftext|>
|0| You can't just hack in on a call like that.<|endoftext|>
|1| Can't I?<|endoftext|>
|0| Who are you?<|endoftext|>
|0| This is a secure call, what are you doing here?<|endoftext|>
|1| Hello. Yeah, I know you should switch me off, but before youdo, watch this.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's here too, I'm getting it.<|endoftext|>
|1| Fermat's Theorem, the proof. And I mean the real one. Neverbeen seen before. Poor old Fermat, got killed in a duel before he couldwrite it down. My fault. I slept in. Oh, and here's an oldie but agoodie. Why electrons have mass. And a personal favourite of mine,faster than light travel with two diagrams and a joke. Look at yourscreens. Whoever I am, I'm a genius. Look at the sun. You need all thehelp you can get. Fellas, pay attention.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sir, what are you doing?<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm writing a computer virus. Very clever, super fast, and atiny bit alive, but don't let on. And why am I writing it on a phone?Never mind, you'll find out. Okay, I'm sending this to all yourcomputers. Get everyone who works for you sending this everywhere.Email, text, Facebook, Bebo, Twitter, radar dish, whatever you've got.Any questions?<|endoftext|>
|0| Who was your lady friend?<|endoftext|>
|1| Patrick, behave.<|endoftext|>
|0| What does this virus do?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's a reset command, that's all. It resets counters. It getsin the wifi and resets every counter it can find. Clocks, calendars,anything with a chip will default at zero at exactly the same time. Butyeah, I could be lying, why should you trust me? I'll let my best manexplain. (sotto) Jeff, you're my best man.<|endoftext|>
|0| You what?<|endoftext|>
|1| Listen to me. In ten minutes, you're going to be a legend. Inten minutes, everyone on that screen is going to be offering you anyjob you want. But first, you have to be magnificent. You have to makethem trust you and get them working. This is it, Jeff, right here,right now. This is when you fly. Today's the day you save the world.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why me?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's your bedroom. Now go, go, go.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, guys, let's do this.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, and delete your internet history.<|endoftext|>
|0| Something's happened up there. We can't getthrough.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm phoning him. Doctor? We're at the hospital, but we can't getthrough.<|endoftext|>
|0| What did he say?<|endoftext|>
|0| Look in the mirror. Ha ha! Uniform. Are you on your way? You'regoing to need a car.<|endoftext|>
|1| Don't worry, I've commandeered a vehicle.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh god.<|endoftext|>
|0| Officer.<|endoftext|>
|0| What happened?<|endoftext|>
|0| There was a man. A man with a dog. I think Doctor Ramsden'sdead. And the nurses.<|endoftext|>
|1| Are you in?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yep.<|endoftext|>
|0| But so's Prisoner Zero.<|endoftext|>
|1| You need to get out of there.<|endoftext|>
|0| He was so angry. He kept shouting andshouting. And that dog. The size of that dog.<|endoftext|>
|0| I swear it was rabid. And he just went mad, attacking everyone.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where did he go, did you see? Has he gone? We hid in the ladies.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, I'm getting it wrong again, aren't I? I'm always doingthat. So many mouths.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, my God!<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy? Amy, what's happening?<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy, talk to me!<|endoftext|>
|0| We're in the coma ward, but it's here. It'sgetting in.<|endoftext|>
|0| Which window are you?<|endoftext|>
|0| What, sorry?<|endoftext|>
|1| Which window?<|endoftext|>
|0| First floor, on the left, fourth from the end.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, dear little Amelia Pond. I've watched you grow up. Twelveyears, and you never even knew I was there. Little Amelia Pond, waitingfor her magic Doctor to return. But not this time, Amelia.<|endoftext|>
|1| Right! Hello. Am I late? No, three minutes to go. So stilltime.<|endoftext|>
|0| Time for what, Time Lord?<|endoftext|>
|1| Take the disguise off. They'll find you in a heartbeat. Nobodydies.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Atraxi will kill me this time. If I am to die, let there befire.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay. You came to this world by opening a crack in space andtime. Do it again. Just leave.<|endoftext|>
|0| I did not open the crack.<|endoftext|>
|0| The cracks in the skin of the universe, don't you know wherethey came from? You don't, do you?<|endoftext|>
|0| The Doctor in the Tardis doesn't know. Doesn't know. Doesn'tknow!<|endoftext|>
|0| The universe is cracked. The Pandorica will open. Silence willfall.<|endoftext|>
|1| And we're off! Look at that. Look at that!<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh! And I think they just found us!<|endoftext|>
|0| The Atraxi are limited. While I'm in this form, they'll stillbe unable to detect me. They've tracked a phone, not me.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, but this is the good bit. I mean, this is my favouritebit. Do you know what this phone is full of? Pictures of you. Everyform you've learned to take, right here. Ooo, and being uploaded aboutnow. And the final score is, no Tardis, no screwdriver, two minutes tospare. Who da man? Oh, I'm never saying that again. Fine.<|endoftext|>
|0| Then I shall take a new form.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, stop it. You know you can't. It takes months to form thatkind of psychic link.<|endoftext|>
|0| And I've had years.<|endoftext|>
|1| No! Amy? You've got to hold on. Amy? Don't sleep! You've got tostay awake, please.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, that's rubbish. Who's that supposed to be?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's you.<|endoftext|>
|0| You don't know?<|endoftext|>
|1| Busy day. Why me, though? You're linked with her. Why are youcopying me?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm not. Poor Amy Pond. Still such a child inside. Dreaming ofthe magic Doctor she knows will return to save her. What adisappointment you've been.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, she's dreaming about me because she can hear me. Amy, don'tjust hear me, listen. Remember the room, the room in your house youcouldn't see. Remember you went inside. I tried to stop, but you did.You went in the room. You went inside. Amy, dream about what you saw.<|endoftext|>
|0| No. No. No!<|endoftext|>
|1| Well done, Prisoner Zero. A perfect impersonation of yourself.<|endoftext|>
|0| Prisoner Zero is located. Prisoner Zero is restrained.<|endoftext|>
|0| Silence, Doctor. Silence will fall.<|endoftext|>
|0| The sun. It's back to normal, right? That's, that's good, yeah?That means it's over.<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy. Are you okay? Are you with us?<|endoftext|>
|0| What happened?<|endoftext|>
|0| He did it. The Doctor did it.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, I didn't.<|endoftext|>
|0| What are you doing?<|endoftext|>
|1| Tracking the signal back. Sorry in advance.<|endoftext|>
|0| About what?<|endoftext|>
|1| The bill.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oi, I didn't say you could go! Article fifty seven of theShadow Proclamation. This is a fully established level five planet, andyou were going to burn it? What? Did you think no-one was watching? Youlot, back here, now. Okay, now I've done it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Did he just bring them back? Did he just save the world fromaliens and then bring all the aliens back again?<|endoftext|>
|0| Where are you going?<|endoftext|>
|1| The roof. No, hang on.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm saving the world - I need a decent shirt. To hell with theraggedy. Time to put on a show.<|endoftext|>
|0| You just summoned aliens back to Earth. Actual aliens, deadlyaliens, aliens of death, and now you're taking your clothes off. Amy,he's taking his clothes off.<|endoftext|>
|1| Turn your back if it embarrasses you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you stealing clothes now? Those clothes belong to people, youknow. (to Amy) Are you not going to turn your back?<|endoftext|>
|0| No.<|endoftext|>
|0| So this was a good idea, was it? They were leaving.<|endoftext|>
|1| Leaving is good. Never coming back is better. Come on, then!The Doctor will see you now.<|endoftext|>
|0| You are not of this world.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, but I've put a lot of work into it.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, hmm, I don't know. What do you think?<|endoftext|>
|0| Is this world important?<|endoftext|>
|1| Important? What's that mean, important? Six billion people livehere. Is that important? Here's a better question. Is this world athreat to the Atraxi? Well, come on. You're monitoring the wholeplanet. Is this world a threat?<|endoftext|>
|0| No.<|endoftext|>
|1| Are the peoples of this world guilty of any crime by the lawsof the Atraxi?<|endoftext|>
|0| No.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay. One more. Just one. Is this world protected? Becauseyou're not the first lot to come here. Oh, there have been so many.<|endoftext|>
|1| And what you've got to ask is, what happened to them?<|endoftext|>
|1| Hello. I'm the Doctor. Basically, run.<|endoftext|>
|0| Is that it? Is that them gone for good? Who were they?<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay, what have you got for me this time?<|endoftext|>
|1| Look at you. Oh, you sexy thing! Look atyou.<|endoftext|>
|1| Sorry about running off earlier. Brand new Tardis. Bitexciting. Just had a quick hop to the moon and back to run her in.She's ready for the big stuff now.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's you. You came back.<|endoftext|>
|1| Course I came back. I always come back. Something wrong withthat?<|endoftext|>
|0| And you kept the clothes.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, I just saved the world. The whole planet, for about themillionth time, no charge. Yeah, shoot me. I kept the clothes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Including the bow tie.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, it's cool. Bow ties are cool.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you from another planet?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay.<|endoftext|>
|1| So what do you think?<|endoftext|>
|0| Of what?<|endoftext|>
|1| Other planets. Want to check some out?<|endoftext|>
|0| What does that mean?<|endoftext|>
|1| It means. Well, it means come with me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where?<|endoftext|>
|1| Wherever you like.<|endoftext|>
|0| All that stuff that happened. The hospital, the spaceships,Prisoner Zero.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, don't worry, that's just the beginning. There's loads more.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, but those things, those amazing things, all that stuff. Thatwas two years ago.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh.! Oops.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah.<|endoftext|>
|1| So that's<|endoftext|>
|0| Fourteen years!<|endoftext|>
|1| Fourteen years since fish custard. Amy Pond, the girl whowaited, you've waited long enough.<|endoftext|>
|0| When I was a kid, you said there was a swimming pool and alibrary, and the swimming pool was in the library.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah. Not sure where it's got to now. It'll turn up. So,coming?<|endoftext|>
|0| No.<|endoftext|>
|1| You wanted to come fourteen years ago.<|endoftext|>
|0| I grew up.<|endoftext|>
|1| Don't worry. I'll soon fix that.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well? Anything you want to say? Any passingremarks? I've heard them all.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm in my nightie.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, don't worry. Plenty of clothes in the wardrobe. Andpossibly a swimming pool. So, all of time and space, everything thatever happened or ever will Where do you want to start?<|endoftext|>
|0| You are so sure that I'm coming.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, I am.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why?<|endoftext|>
|1| Cause you're the Scottish girl in the English village, and Iknow how that feels.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, do you?<|endoftext|>
|1| All these years living here, most of your life, and you'vestill got that accent. Yeah, you're coming.<|endoftext|>
|0| Can you get me back for tomorrow morning?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's a time machine. I can get you back five minutes ago. Why,what's tomorrow?<|endoftext|>
|0| Nothing. Nothing. Just you know, stuff.<|endoftext|>
|1| All right, then. Back in time for stuff.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh! A new one! Lovely. Thanks, dear.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why me?<|endoftext|>
|1| Why not?<|endoftext|>
|0| No, seriously. You are asking me to run away with you in themiddle of the night. It's a fair question. Why me?<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't know. Fun. Do I have to have a reason?<|endoftext|>
|0| People always have a reason.<|endoftext|>
|1| Do I look like people?<|endoftext|>
|1| Been knocking around on my own for a while. My choice, but I'vestarted talking to myself all the time. It's giving me earache.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're lonely. That's it? Just that?<|endoftext|>
|1| Just that. Promise.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay.<|endoftext|>
|1| So, are you okay, then? Because this place, sometimes it canmake people feel a bit, you know.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm fine. It's just, there's a whole world in here, just like yousaid. It's all true. I thought. Well, I started to think that maybe youwere just like a madman with a box.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy Pond, there's something you'd better understand about me,because it's important, and one day your life may depend on it. I amdefinitely a madman with a box. Ha ha! Yeah. Goodbye Leadworth, helloeverything.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well done, Mabel. Well done, Alfie. Good girl, Tabitha. Verywell done, Ranjit. Good girl, Chloe. Well done, Ben. Well done, Mandy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Bad boy, Timmy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Zero.<|endoftext|>
|0| You got a zero, didn't you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah? So?<|endoftext|>
|0| You'll have to walk home then.<|endoftext|>
|0| Walk to London? That's twenty decks!<|endoftext|>
|0| You can't ride a Vator with a zero. You know what happens.You'll get sent below.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'll wait for you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Welcome to Vator Verse, sponsored by McLintock's Candy Burgers.TIMMY<|endoftext|>
|0| A horse and a man, above, below. One has a plan, butboth must go. Mile after mile, above, beneath. One has a smile, and onehas teeth.<|endoftext|>
|0| Though the man above might say hello, expect no lovefrom the beast below.<|endoftext|>
|0| Help! Help me!<|endoftext|>
|0| My name is Amy Pond. When I was seven, I had an imaginaryfriend. Last night was the night before my wedding.<|endoftext|>
|1| Come on, Pond.<|endoftext|>
|0| And my imaginary friend came back.<|endoftext|>
|1| Now do you believe me?<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, your box is a spaceship. It's really, really a spaceship. Weare in space! What are we breathing?<|endoftext|>
|1| I've extended the air shell. We're fine.<|endoftext|>
|1| Now that's interesting. Twenty ninth century. Solar flaresroast the earth, and the entire human race packs its bags and moves outtill the weather improves. Whole nations.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|1| Migrating to the stars.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|1| Isn't that amazing?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, come on. I've found us a spaceship. This is the UnitedKingdom of Britain and Northern Ireland. All of it, bolted together andfloating in the sky.Starship UK. It's Britain, but metal. That's not just a ship, that's anidea. That's a whole country, living and laughing and shopping.Searching the stars for a new home.<|endoftext|>
|0| Can we go out and see?<|endoftext|>
|1| Course we can. But first, there's a thing.<|endoftext|>
|0| A thing?<|endoftext|>
|1| An important thing. In fact, Thing One. We are observers only.That's the one rule I've always stuck to in all my travels. I never getinvolved in the affairs of other peoples or planets.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ooo, that's interesting.<|endoftext|>
|0| So we're like a wildlife documentary, yeah? Because if they see awounded little cub or something, they can't just save it, they've gotto keep filming and let it die. It's got to be hard. I don't think Icould do that. Don't you find that hard, being all, like, detached andcold?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|0| Welcome to London Market. You are beingmonitored.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm in the future. Like hundreds of years in the future. I've beendead for centuries.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, lovely. You're a cheery one. Never mind dead, look at thisplace. Isn't it wrong?<|endoftext|>
|0| What's wrong?<|endoftext|>
|1| Come on, use your eyes. Notice everything. What's wrong withthis picture?<|endoftext|>
|0| Is it the bicycles? Bit unusual on a spaceship, bicycles.<|endoftext|>
|1| Says the girl in the nightie.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh my God, I'm in my nightie.<|endoftext|>
|1| Now, come on, look around you. Actually look.<|endoftext|>
|0| London Market is a crime-free zone.<|endoftext|>
|1| Life on a giant starship. Back to basics. Bicycles, washinglines, wind-up street lamps. But look closer. Secrets and shadows,lives led in fear. Society bent out of shape, on the brink of collapse.A police state. Excuse me.<|endoftext|>
|0| What are you doing?<|endoftext|>
|1| Sorry. Checking all the water in this area. There's an escapedfish. Where was I?<|endoftext|>
|0| Why did you just do that with the water?<|endoftext|>
|1| Don't know. I think a lot. It's hard to keep track. Now, policestate. Do you see it yet?<|endoftext|>
|0| Where?<|endoftext|>
|1| There.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you sure?<|endoftext|>
|0| Saw it myself.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you going to tell her?<|endoftext|>
|0| We're under orders to tell her.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well done. Keep tabs on him.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry to interrupt. There's been a sighting. Londonblock, Oxford Street. A man.<|endoftext|>
|0| Did he do the thing?<|endoftext|>
|0| Apparently.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'll have a look on the monitors.<|endoftext|>
|0| One little girl crying. So?<|endoftext|>
|1| Crying silently. I mean, children cry because they wantattention, because they're hurt or afraid. But when they cry silently,it's because they just can't stop. Any parent knows that.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you a parent?<|endoftext|>
|1| Hundreds of parents walking past who spot her and not one ofthem's asking her what's wrong, which means they already know, and it'ssomething they don't talk about. Secrets. They're not helping her, soit's something they're afraid of. Shadows, whatever they're afraid of,it's nowhere to be seen, which means it's everywhere. Police state.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where'd she go?<|endoftext|>
|1| Deck two oh seven. Apple Sesame block, dwelling 54A. You'relooking for Mandy Tanner. Oh, er, this fell out of her pocket when Iaccidentally bumped into her. Took me four goes. Ask her about thosethings. The smiling fellows in the booths. They're everywhere.<|endoftext|>
|0| But they're just things.<|endoftext|>
|1| They're clean. Everything else here is all battered and filthy.Look at this place. But no one's laid a finger on those booths. Not afootprint within two feet of them. Look. Ask Mandy, why are peoplescared of the things in the booths?<|endoftext|>
|0| No, hang on. What do I do? I don't know what I'm doing here andI'm not even dressed.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's this or Leadworth. What do you think? Let's see. What willAmy Pond choose? Ha ha, gotcha. Meet me back here in half an hour.<|endoftext|>
|0| What are you going to do?<|endoftext|>
|1| What I always do. Stay out of trouble. Badly.<|endoftext|>
|0| So is this how it works, Doctor? You never interfere in theaffairs of other peoples or planets, unless there's children crying?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're following me. Saw you watching me at the marketplace.<|endoftext|>
|0| You dropped this.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, when your friend kept bumping into me.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's that?<|endoftext|>
|0| There's a hole. We have to go back.<|endoftext|>
|0| A what? A hole?<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you stupid? There's a hole in the road. We can't go thatway. There's a travel pipe down by the airlocks, if you've got stamps.What are you doing?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, don't mind me. Never could resist a keep out sign. What'sthrough there? What's so scary about a hole? Something under the road?<|endoftext|>
|0| Nobody knows. We're not supposed to talk about it.<|endoftext|>
|0| About what?<|endoftext|>
|0| Below.<|endoftext|>
|0| And because you're not supposed to, you don't? Watch and learn.<|endoftext|>
|0| You sound Scottish.<|endoftext|>
|0| I am Scottish. What's wrong with that? Scotland's got to be heresomewhere.<|endoftext|>
|0| No. They wanted their own ship.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hmm. Good for them. Nothing changes.<|endoftext|>
|0| So, how did you get here?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, just passing through, you know, with a guy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Your boyfriend?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh.<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|0| Nothing. It's just, I'm getting married. Funny how things slipyour mind.<|endoftext|>
|0| Married?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, shut up, married. Really, actually married. Almostdefinitely.<|endoftext|>
|0| When?<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, it's kind of weird. A long time ago tomorrow morning. Iwonder what I did? Hey, hey. Result! Coming?<|endoftext|>
|0| No!<|endoftext|>
|0| Suit yourself.<|endoftext|>
|0| Stop! You mustn't do that!<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, my God. That's weird. That's.<|endoftext|>
|0| The impossible truth in a glass of water. Not many people see it.But you do, don't you, Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|1| You know me?<|endoftext|>
|0| Keep your voice down. They're everywhere. Tell me what you see inthe glass.<|endoftext|>
|1| Who says I see anything?<|endoftext|>
|1| No engine vibration on deck. Ship this size, engine this big,you'd feel it. The water would move. So, I thought I'd take a look. Itdoesn't make sense. These power couplings, they're not connected. Look.Look, they're dummies, see? And behind this wall, nothing. It's hollow.If I didn't know better, I'd say there was<|endoftext|>
|0| No engine at all.<|endoftext|>
|1| But it's working. This ship is travelling though space. I sawit.<|endoftext|>
|0| The impossible truth, Doctor. We're travelling among the stars ina spaceship that could never fly.<|endoftext|>
|1| How?<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't know. There's a darkness at the heart of this nation. Itthreatens every one of us. Help us, Doctor. You're our only hope. Yourfriend is safe. This will take you to her. Now go, quickly!<|endoftext|>
|1| Who are you? How do I find you again?<|endoftext|>
|0| I am Liz Ten, and I will find you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Welcome to voting cubicle three thirty C. Please leave thisinstallation as you would wish to find it. The United Kingdomrecognises the right to know of all its citizens. A presentationconcerning the history of Starship UK will begin shortly. Your identityis being verified on our electoral roll. Name, Amelia Jessica Pond.Age, thirteen hundred and six.<|endoftext|>
|0| Shut up.<|endoftext|>
|0| Marital status, unknown.<|endoftext|>
|0| You are here because you want to know the truthabout this starship, and I am talking to you because you're entitled toknow. When this presentation has finished, you will have a choice. Youmay either protest. or forget. If you choose to protest, understandthis. If just one percent of the population of this ship do likewise,the programme will be discontinued with consequences for you all. Ifyou choose to accept the situation, and we hope that you will, thenpress the Forget button. All the information I'm about to give you willbe erased from your memory. You will continue to enjoy the safety andamenities of Starship UK, unburdened by the knowledge of what has beendone to save you. Here then, is the truth about Starship UK, and theprice that has been paid for the safety of the British people. May Godhave mercy on our souls.<|endoftext|>
|0| This isn't a trick. This is for real. You've got tofind the Doctor and get him back to the Tardis. Don't let himinvestigate. Stop him. Do whatever you have to, just please, please getthe Doctor off this ship!<|endoftext|>
|0| Listen to me. This isn't a trick. This is for real.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy?<|endoftext|>
|0| You've got to find the Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| What have you done?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, your basic memory wipe job. Must have erased about twentyminutes.<|endoftext|>
|0| But why would I choose to forget?<|endoftext|>
|0| Because everyone does. Everyone chooses the Forget button.<|endoftext|>
|1| Did you?<|endoftext|>
|1| And once every five years, everyone chooses to forget whatthey've learned. Democracy in action.<|endoftext|>
|0| How do you not know about this? Are you Scottish too?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, I'm way worse than Scottish. I can't even see the movie.Won't play for me.<|endoftext|>
|0| It played for me.<|endoftext|>
|1| The difference being the computer doesn't accept me as human.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why not? You look human.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, you look Time Lord. We came first.<|endoftext|>
|0| So there are other Time Lords, yeah?<|endoftext|>
|1| No. There were, but there aren't. Just me now. Long story.There was a bad day. Bad stuff happened. And you know what? I'd love toforget it all, every last bit of it, but I don't. Not ever. Becausethis is what I do, every time, every day, every second. This. Holdtight. We're bringing down the government.<|endoftext|>
|1| Say wheee!<|endoftext|>
|0| Argh!<|endoftext|>
|0| It's all right, love.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's only me.<|endoftext|>
|1| Argh! High speed air cannon. Lousy way to travel.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where are we?<|endoftext|>
|1| Six hundred feet down, twenty miles laterally, puts us at theheart of the ship. I'd say Lancashire. What's this then, a cave? Can'tbe a cave. Looks like a cave.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's a rubbish dump, and it's minging!<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, but only food refuse. Organic, coming through feeder tubesfrom all over the ship.<|endoftext|>
|0| The floor's all squidgy, like a water bed.<|endoftext|>
|1| But feeding what, though?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's sort of rubbery, feel it. Wet and slimy.<|endoftext|>
|1| Er, it's not a floor, it's a. So.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's a what?<|endoftext|>
|1| The next word is kind of a scary word. You probably want totake a moment, get yourself in a calm place. Go omm.<|endoftext|>
|0| Omm.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's a tongue.<|endoftext|>
|0| A tongue?<|endoftext|>
|1| A tongue. A great big tongue.<|endoftext|>
|0| This is a mouth. This whole place is a mouth? We're in a mouth?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, yes, yes. But on the plus side, roomy.<|endoftext|>
|0| How do we get out?<|endoftext|>
|1| How big is this beastie? It's gorgeous. Blimey, if this is justthe mouth, I'd love to see the stomach. Though not right now.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, how do we get out?<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay, it's being fed through surgically implanted feeder tubes,so the normal entrance is closed for business.<|endoftext|>
|0| We could try, though.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, stop, don't move.<|endoftext|>
|1| Too late. It's started.<|endoftext|>
|0| What has?<|endoftext|>
|1| Swallow reflex.<|endoftext|>
|0| What are you doing?<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm vibrating the chemo-receptors.<|endoftext|>
|0| Chemo-what?<|endoftext|>
|1| The eject button.<|endoftext|>
|0| How does a mouth have an eject button?<|endoftext|>
|1| Think about it!<|endoftext|>
|1| Right, then. This isn't going to be big on dignity. Geronimo!<|endoftext|>
|1| There's nothing broken, there's no sign ofconcussion and yes, you are covered in sick.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where are we?<|endoftext|>
|1| Overspill pipe, at a guess.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, God, it stinks.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, that's not the pipe.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh. Phew. Can we get out?<|endoftext|>
|1| One door, one door switch, one condition. We forget everythingwe saw. Look familiar?<|endoftext|>
|1| That's the carrot. Ooo, here's the stick.<|endoftext|>
|1| There's a creature living in the heart of this ship. What's itdoing there?<|endoftext|>
|1| No, that's not going to work on me, so come on. Big old beastbelow decks, and everyone who protests gets shoved down its throat.That how it works?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|1| Look who it is. You look a lot better without your mask.<|endoftext|>
|0| You must be Amy. Liz. Liz Ten.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hi.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yuck. Lovely hair, Amy. Shame about the sick. You know Mandy,yeah? She's very brave.<|endoftext|>
|1| How did you find us?<|endoftext|>
|0| Stuck my gizmo on you. Been listening in. Nice moves on the hurlescape. So, what's the big fella doing here?<|endoftext|>
|1| You're over sixteen, you've voted. Whatever this is, you'vechosen to forget about it.<|endoftext|>
|0| No. Never forgot, never voted, not technically a British subject.<|endoftext|>
|1| Then who and what are you, and how do you know me?<|endoftext|>
|0| You're a bit hard to miss, love. Mysterious stranger, M Oconsistent with higher alien intelligence, hair of an idiot. I've beenbrought up on the stories. My whole family was.<|endoftext|>
|1| Your family?<|endoftext|>
|0| They're repairing. Doesn't take them long. Let's move.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Doctor. Old drinking buddy of HenryTwelve. Tea and scones with Liz Two. Vicky was a bit on the fence aboutyou, weren't she? Knighted and exiled you on the same day. And so muchfor the Virgin Queen, you bad, bad boy.<|endoftext|>
|1| Liz Ten.<|endoftext|>
|0| Liz Ten, yeah. Elizabeth the Tenth. And down!<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm the bloody Queen, mate. Basically, I rule.<|endoftext|>
|0| There's a high-speed Vator through there. Oh,yeah. There's these things.<|endoftext|>
|0| Any ideas?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, I saw one of these up top. There was a hole in the road,like it had burst through like a root.<|endoftext|>
|1| Exactly like a root. It's all one creature, the same one wewere inside, reaching out. It must be growing through the mechanisms ofthe entire ship.<|endoftext|>
|0| What, like an infestation? Someone's helping it. Feeding it.Feeding my subjects to it. Come on. Got to keep moving.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, Amy. We should never have come here.<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't let him investigate. Stop him. Do whatever you have to,just please, please get the Doctor off this ship.<|endoftext|>
|0| Winder division one. Ten has penetratedto the lower levels. Initiate the protocol. God save the Queen.<|endoftext|>
|1| Why all the glasses?<|endoftext|>
|0| To remind me every single day that my government is up tosomething, and it's my duty to find out what.<|endoftext|>
|1| A queen going undercover to investigate her own kingdom?<|endoftext|>
|0| Secrets are being kept from me. I don't have a choice. Ten yearsI've been at this. My entire reign. And you've achieved more in oneafternoon.<|endoftext|>
|1| How old were you when you came to the throne?<|endoftext|>
|0| Forty. Why?<|endoftext|>
|0| What, you're fifty now? No way.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, they slowed my body clock. Keeps me looking like the stamps.<|endoftext|>
|1| And you always wear this in public?<|endoftext|>
|0| Undercover's not easy when you're me. The autographs, the bunting.<|endoftext|>
|1| Air-balanced porcelain. Stays on by itself, because it'sperfectly sculpted to your face.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah? So what?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, Liz. So everything.<|endoftext|>
|0| What are you doing? How dare you come in here?<|endoftext|>
|0| Ma'am, you have expressed interest in the interior workings ofStarship UK. You will come with us now.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why would I do that?<|endoftext|>
|0| How can they be Smilers?<|endoftext|>
|1| Half Smiler, half human.<|endoftext|>
|0| Whatever you creatures are, I am still your queen. On whoseauthority is this done?<|endoftext|>
|0| The highest authority, Ma'am.<|endoftext|>
|0| I am the highest authority.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, ma'am. You must go now, Ma'am.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where?<|endoftext|>
|0| The Tower, Ma'am.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, where are we?<|endoftext|>
|1| The lowest point of Starship UK. The dungeon.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ma'am.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hawthorne. So this is where you hid yourself away. I think you'vegot some explaining to do.<|endoftext|>
|1| There's children down here. What's all that about?<|endoftext|>
|0| Protesters and citizens of limited value are fed to thebeast. For some reason, it won't eat the children. You're the firstadults it's spared. You're very lucky.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, look at us. Torture chamber of the Tower of London.Lucky, lucky, lucky. Except it's not a torture chamber, is it? Well,except it is. Except it isn't. Depends on your angle.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's that?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, like I say, it depends on the angle. It's either theexposed pain centre of big fella's brain, being tortured relentlessly.<|endoftext|>
|0| Or?<|endoftext|>
|1| Or it's the gas pedal, the accelerator. Starship UK's go fasterbutton.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't understand.<|endoftext|>
|1| Don't you? Try to. Go on. The spaceship that could never fly.No vibration on deck. This creature, this poor, trapped, terrifiedcreature. It's not infesting you, it's not invading, it's what you haveinstead of an engine. And this place down here is where you hurt it,where you torture it, day after day, just to keep it moving. Tell youwhat. Normally, it's above the range of human hearing. This is thesound none of you wanted to hear.<|endoftext|>
|0| Stop it. Who did this?<|endoftext|>
|0| We act on instructions from the highest authority.<|endoftext|>
|0| I am the highest authority. The creature will be released, now. Isaid now! Is anyone listening to me?<|endoftext|>
|1| Liz. Your mask.<|endoftext|>
|0| What about my mask?<|endoftext|>
|1| Look at it. It's old. At least two hundred years old, I'd say.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah? It's an antique. So?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, an antique made by craftsmen over two hundred years agoand perfectly sculpted to your face. They slowed your body clock, allright, but you're not fifty. Nearer three hundred. And it's been a longold reign.<|endoftext|>
|0| Nah, it's ten years. I've been on this throne ten years.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ten years. And the same ten years, over and over again, alwaysleading you here.<|endoftext|>
|0| What have you done?<|endoftext|>
|0| Only what you have ordered. We work for you, Ma'am. TheWinders, the Smilers, all of us.<|endoftext|>
|0| If you are watching this. If I am watching this, thenI have found my way to the Tower Of London. The creature you arelooking at is called a Star Whale. Once, there were millions of them.They lived in the depths of space and, according to legend, guided theearly space travellers through the asteroid belts. This one, as far aswe are aware, is the last of its kind. And what we have done to itbreaks my heart. The Earth was burning. Our sun had turned on us andevery other nation had fled to the skies. Our children screamed as theskies grew hotter. And then it came, like a miracle. The last of theStar Whales. We trapped it, we built our ship around it, and we rode onits back to safety. If you wish our voyage to continue, then you mustpress the Forget button. Be again the heart of this nation, untainted.If not, press the other button. Your reign will end, the Star Whalewill be released, and our ship will disintegrate. I hope I keep thestrength to make the right decision.<|endoftext|>
|0| I voted for this. Why would I do that?<|endoftext|>
|1| Because you knew if we stayed here, I'd be faced with animpossible choice. Humanity or the alien. You took it upon yourself tosave me from that. And that was wrong. You don't ever decide what Ineed to know.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't even remember doing it.<|endoftext|>
|1| You did it. That's what counts.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm, I'm sorry.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, I don't care. When I'm done here, you're going home.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why? Because I made a mistake? One mistake? I don't even rememberdoing it. Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, I know. You're only human.<|endoftext|>
|0| What are you doing?<|endoftext|>
|1| The worst thing I'll ever do. I'm going to pass a massiveelectrical charge through the Star Whale's brain. Should knock out allits higher functions, leave it a vegetable. The ship will still fly,but the whale won't feel it.<|endoftext|>
|0| That'll be like killing it.<|endoftext|>
|1| Look, three options. One, I let the Star Whale continue inunendurable agony for hundreds more years. Two, I kill everyone on thisship. Three, I murder a beautiful, innocent creature as painlessly as Ican. And then I find a new name, because I won't be the Doctor anymore.<|endoftext|>
|0| There must be something we can do, some other way.<|endoftext|>
|1| Nobody talk to me. Nobody human has anything to say to metoday!<|endoftext|>
|0| Timmy! You made it, you're okay. It's me, Mandy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Come on, use your eyes. Notice everything. Noticeeverything.<|endoftext|>
|0| Our children screamed. It came, like a miracle.<|endoftext|>
|0| It won't eat the children.<|endoftext|>
|0| The children screamed, then it came. It's the last ofits kind.<|endoftext|>
|0| Just me now.<|endoftext|>
|0| The last of its kind.<|endoftext|>
|0| Is this how it works, Doctor? You never interfere with otherpeoples or planets.<|endoftext|>
|0| Children screamed.<|endoftext|>
|0| Unless it's children crying.<|endoftext|>
|0| The last of its kind.<|endoftext|>
|0| Just me now.<|endoftext|>
|0| Unless there's children crying.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| It won't eat the children.<|endoftext|>
|0| Then it came, like a miracle. The last of the Star Whales.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, stop. Whatever you're doing, stop it now! Sorry, YourMajesty. Going to need a hand.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy, no! No!<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy, what have you done?<|endoftext|>
|0| Nothing at all. Am I right?<|endoftext|>
|0| We've increased speed.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, well, you've stopped torturing the pilot. Got to help.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's still here. I don't understand.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Star Whale didn't come like a miracle all those years ago. Itvolunteered. You didn't have to trap it or torture it. That was alljust you. It came because it couldn't stand to watch your children cry.What if you were really old, and really kind and alone? Your whole racedead. No future. What couldn't you do then? If you were that old, andthat kind, and the very last of your kind, you couldn't just standthere and watch children cry.<|endoftext|>
|0| From Her Majesty. She says there will be nomore secrets on Starship UK.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy, you could have killed everyone on this ship.<|endoftext|>
|0| You could have killed a Star Whale.<|endoftext|>
|1| And you saved it. I know, I know.<|endoftext|>
|0| Amazing though, don't you think? The Star Whale. All that pain andmisery and loneliness, and it just made it kind.<|endoftext|>
|1| But you couldn't have known how it would react.<|endoftext|>
|0| You couldn't. But I've seen it before. Very old and very kind, andthe very, very last. Sound a bit familiar?<|endoftext|>
|0| Hey.<|endoftext|>
|1| What?<|endoftext|>
|0| Gotcha.<|endoftext|>
|1| Huh. Gotcha.<|endoftext|>
|0| Shouldn't we say goodbye? Won't they wonderwhere we went?<|endoftext|>
|1| For the rest of their lives. Oh, the songs they'll write. Nevermind them. Big day tomorrow.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry, what?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, it's always a big day tomorrow. We've got a time machine.I skip the little ones.<|endoftext|>
|0| You know what I said about getting back for tomorrow morning? Haveyou ever run away from something because you were scared, or not ready,or just, just because you could?<|endoftext|>
|1| Once, a long time ago.<|endoftext|>
|0| What happened?<|endoftext|>
|1| Hello.<|endoftext|>
|0| Right. Doctor, there's something I haven't told you. No, hang on.Is that a phone ringing?<|endoftext|>
|0| People phone you?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, it's a phone box. Would you mind?<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello? Sorry, who? No, seriously, who? Says he's the PrimeMinister. First the Queen, now the Prime Minister. Get about, don'tyou?<|endoftext|>
|1| Which Prime Minister?<|endoftext|>
|0| Er, which Prime Minister? The British one.<|endoftext|>
|1| Which British one?<|endoftext|>
|0| Which British one? Winston Churchill for you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh! Hello, dear. What's up?<|endoftext|>
|0| Tricky situation, Doctor. Potentiallyvery dangerous. I think I'm going to need you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't worry about a thing, Prime Minister.<|endoftext|>
|1| We're on our way.<|endoftext|>
|0| In bed above, we're deep asleep, while greater love liesfurther deep. This dream must end, this world must know, we all dependon the beast below.<|endoftext|>
|0| Can't we shut that ruddy thing up?<|endoftext|>
|0| If wishes were kisses.<|endoftext|>
|0| Flight two advancing from Biggin Hill.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hostile thirty six, confirm please.<|endoftext|>
|0| Able Victor Charlie down.<|endoftext|>
|0| Twenty six and forty one detailed to intercept.<|endoftext|>
|0| Forty one? That, that's Reg's squadron.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sir.<|endoftext|>
|0| How many?<|endoftext|>
|0| Looks like a dozen Heinkel at least, sir, with Messerschmittsflanking.<|endoftext|>
|0| Out of range?<|endoftext|>
|0| Normally, sir, yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well then, time to roll out the secret weapon.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy? Winston Churchill.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor. Is it you?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, Winston, my old friend.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah, every time.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's he after?<|endoftext|>
|1| Tardis key, of course.<|endoftext|>
|0| Think of what I could achieve with your remarkable machine,Doctor. The lives that could be saved.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah, doesn't work like that.<|endoftext|>
|0| Must I take it by force?<|endoftext|>
|1| I'd like to see you try.<|endoftext|>
|0| At ease.<|endoftext|>
|1| You rang?<|endoftext|>
|0| So you've changed your face again.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, well, had a bit of work done.<|endoftext|>
|0| Got it, got it, got it. Cabinet War Rooms, right?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yep. Top secret heart of the War Office, right under London.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're late, by the way.<|endoftext|>
|0| Requisitions, sir.<|endoftext|>
|0| Excellent.<|endoftext|>
|1| Late?<|endoftext|>
|0| I rang you a month ago.<|endoftext|>
|1| Really? Sorry, sorry. It's a Type Forty Tardis, it's. I'm justrunning her in.<|endoftext|>
|0| Something the matter, Breen? You look a little down in thedumps.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, sir. Fine, sir.<|endoftext|>
|0| Action this day, Breen. Action this day.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, sir.<|endoftext|>
|0| Excuse me, sir. Got another formation coming in, Prime Minister.Stukas, by the look of them.<|endoftext|>
|0| We shall go up top then, Group Captain. We'll give them whatfor. Coming, Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|1| Why?<|endoftext|>
|0| I have something to show you.<|endoftext|>
|0| We stand at a crossroads, Doctor, quitealone, with our backs to the wall. Invasion is expected daily. So Iwill grasp with both hands anything that will give us an advantage overthe Nazi menace.<|endoftext|>
|1| Such as?<|endoftext|>
|0| Follow me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Wow.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, this is Professor Edwin Bracewell. Head of ourIronsides Project.<|endoftext|>
|0| How do you do?<|endoftext|>
|0| Two flights JU thirty eights approaching from the east.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, Doctor. Doctor, it's<|endoftext|>
|1| History.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ready, Bracewell?<|endoftext|>
|0| Aye aye, sir. On my order, fire!<|endoftext|>
|0| What was that?<|endoftext|>
|1| That wasn't human. That was never human technology. Thatsounded like. Show me. Show me. Show me what that was!<|endoftext|>
|0| Advance.<|endoftext|>
|0| Our new secret weapon. Ha!<|endoftext|>
|0| What do you think? Quite something, eh?<|endoftext|>
|1| What are you doing here?<|endoftext|>
|0| I am your soldier.<|endoftext|>
|1| What?<|endoftext|>
|0| I am your soldier.<|endoftext|>
|1| Stop this. Stop now. Now, you know who I am. You always know.<|endoftext|>
|0| Your identity is unknown.<|endoftext|>
|0| Perhaps I can clarify things here. This is one of myIronsides.<|endoftext|>
|1| Your what?<|endoftext|>
|0| You will help the Allied cause in any way that you can.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Until the Germans have been utterly smashed.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| And what is your ultimate aim?<|endoftext|>
|0| To win the war.<|endoftext|>
|1| They're Daleks. They're called Daleks.<|endoftext|>
|0| They are Bracewell's Ironsides, Doctor. Look. Blueprints,statistics, field tests, photographs. He invented them.<|endoftext|>
|1| Invented them? Oh, no, no, no.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes. He approached one of our brass hats a few months ago.Fellow's a genius.<|endoftext|>
|0| A Scottish genius, too. Maybe you should listen to<|endoftext|>
|1| Shush. He didn't invent them. They're alien.<|endoftext|>
|0| Alien.<|endoftext|>
|1| And totally hostile.<|endoftext|>
|0| Precisely. They will win me the war.<|endoftext|>
|1| Why won't you listen to me? Why did youcall me in if you won't listen to me?<|endoftext|>
|0| When I rang you a month ago, I must admit I had my doubts.The Ironsides seemed too good to be true.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes. Right. So destroy them. Exterminate them.<|endoftext|>
|0| But imagine what I could do with a hundred. A thousand.<|endoftext|>
|1| I am imagining.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy, tell him.<|endoftext|>
|0| Tell him what?<|endoftext|>
|1| About the Daleks.<|endoftext|>
|0| What would I know about the Daleks?<|endoftext|>
|1| Everything. They invaded your world, remember? Planets in thesky. You don't forget that. Amy, tell me you remember the Daleks.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, sorry.<|endoftext|>
|1| That's not possible.<|endoftext|>
|0| Blue leader to Two squadron and six twothree five seven. Over.<|endoftext|>
|0| Bandits at ten o'clock.<|endoftext|>
|0| Two three five seven. Over.<|endoftext|>
|1| So, they're up to something. But what is it? What are theyafter?<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, let's just ask, shall we?<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy. Amelia!<|endoftext|>
|0| Can I be of assistance?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh. Yes, yes. See, my friend reckons you're dangerous. That you'rean alien. Is it true?<|endoftext|>
|0| I am your soldier.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah. Got that bit. Love a squaddie. What else, though?<|endoftext|>
|0| Please excuse me. I have duties to perform.<|endoftext|>
|1| Winston. Winston, please.<|endoftext|>
|0| We are waging total war, Doctor. Day after day the Luftwaffepound this great city like an iron fist.<|endoftext|>
|1| Wait till the Daleks get started.<|endoftext|>
|0| Men, women and children slaughtered. Families torn apart.Wren's churches in flame.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah. Try the Earth in flames.<|endoftext|>
|0| I weep for my country. I weep for my empire. It is breakingmy heart.<|endoftext|>
|1| You're resisting, Winston. The whole world knows you'reresisting. You're a beacon of hope.<|endoftext|>
|0| But for how long? Millions of innocent lives will be savedif I use these Ironsides now.<|endoftext|>
|0| Can I be of assistance?<|endoftext|>
|1| Shut it. Listen to me. Just listen. The Daleks have noconscience, no mercy, no pity. They are my oldest and deadliest enemy.You cannot trust them.<|endoftext|>
|0| If Hitler invaded hell, I would give a favourable referenceto the Devil. These machines are our salvation.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, the All Clear. We are safe, for now.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, it's the All Clear. You okay?<|endoftext|>
|1| What does hate look like, Amy?<|endoftext|>
|0| Hate?<|endoftext|>
|1| It looks like a Dalek. And I'm going to prove it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Would you care for some tea?<|endoftext|>
|0| That would be very nice, thank you.<|endoftext|>
|1| All right, Prof. Now, the PM's been filling me in. Amazingthings, these Ironsides of yours. Amazing. You must be very proud ofthem.<|endoftext|>
|0| Just doing my bit.<|endoftext|>
|0| Not bad for a Paisley boy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, I thought I detected a familiar cadence, my dear.<|endoftext|>
|1| How did you do it? Come up with the idea?<|endoftext|>
|0| How does the muse of invention come to anyone?<|endoftext|>
|1| But you get a lot of these clever notions, do you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, ideas just seem to teem from my head. Wonderfulthings, like. Let me show you. Some musings on the potential ofhypersonic flight. Gravity bubbles that can sustain life outside of theterrestrial atmosphere. Came to me in the bath.<|endoftext|>
|1| And are these your ideas or theirs?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh no, no, no. These robots are entirely under my control,Doctor. They are.<|endoftext|>
|0| Thank you. The perfect servant, and the perfect warrior.<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't know what you're up to, Professor, but whatever they'vepromised, you cannot trust them. Call them what you like, the Daleksare death.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, Doctor. Death to our enemies. Death to the forces ofdarkness, and death to the Third Reich.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, Winston, and death to everyone else too.<|endoftext|>
|0| Would you care for some tea?<|endoftext|>
|1| Stop this! What are you doing here? What do you want?<|endoftext|>
|0| We seek only to help you.<|endoftext|>
|1| To do what?<|endoftext|>
|0| To win the war.<|endoftext|>
|1| Really? Which war?<|endoftext|>
|0| I do not understand.<|endoftext|>
|1| This war, against the Nazis, or your war? The war against therest of the Universe? The war against all life forms that are notDalek?<|endoftext|>
|0| I do not understand. I am your soldier.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, yeah? Okay. Okay, soldier, defend yourself.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, what the devil?<|endoftext|>
|0| You do not require tea?<|endoftext|>
|0| Stop him! Prime Minister, please.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, what the devil? Please, these machines are precious.<|endoftext|>
|1| Come on. Fight back. You want to, don't you? You know you do.<|endoftext|>
|0| I must protest.<|endoftext|>
|1| What are you waiting for? Look, you hate me. You want to killme. Well, go on. Kill me. Kill me!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, be careful.<|endoftext|>
|0| Please desist from striking me. I am your soldier.<|endoftext|>
|1| You are my enemy! And I am yours. You are everything I despise.The worst thing in all creation. I've defeated you time and time again.I've defeated you. I sent you back into the Void. I saved the whole ofreality from you. I am the Doctor. And you are the Daleks.<|endoftext|>
|0| Correct. Review testimony.<|endoftext|>
|0| I am the Doctor. And you are the Daleks.<|endoftext|>
|1| Testimony. What are you talking about, testimony?<|endoftext|>
|0| Transmitting testimony now.<|endoftext|>
|1| Transmit what, where?<|endoftext|>
|0| Receiving testimony now. <|endoftext|>
|0| I am the Doctor. And you are the Daleks.<|endoftext|>
|0| Progenitor activated. Testimony accepted. Testimony accepted.<|endoftext|>
|0| Testimony accepted.<|endoftext|>
|1| Get back, all of you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Marines! Marines, get in here.<|endoftext|>
|0| Stop it, stop it, please. What are you doing? You are myIronsides.<|endoftext|>
|0| We are the Daleks.<|endoftext|>
|0| But I created you.<|endoftext|>
|0| No.<|endoftext|>
|0| We created you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Victory. Victory. Victory.<|endoftext|>
|0| What just happened, Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|1| I wanted to know what they wanted. What their plan was. I wastheir plan.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hey!<|endoftext|>
|0| Commencing Phase Two. The Progenitor is activated. It begins.<|endoftext|>
|1| Testimony accepted. That's what they said.My testimony.<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't beat yourself up because you were right. So, what do we do?Is this what we do now? Chase after them?<|endoftext|>
|1| This is what I do. yeah, and it's dangerous, so you wait here.<|endoftext|>
|0| What, so you mean I've got to stay safe down here in the middle ofthe London Blitz?<|endoftext|>
|1| Safe as it gets around me.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's he expect us to do now?<|endoftext|>
|0| K B O, of course.<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|0| Keep buggering on.<|endoftext|>
|1| Come on. Bingo!<|endoftext|>
|0| Prime Minister.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes?<|endoftext|>
|0| Signal from RDF, sir. Unidentified object. Hanging in the sky,Captain Childers says. We can't get a proper fix, though. It's too farup.<|endoftext|>
|0| What do you think, Miss Pond? The Doctor's in trouble andnow we know where he is.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah. Because he'll be on that ship, won't he. Right in the middleof everything.<|endoftext|>
|0| Exactly.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oi, put that light out.<|endoftext|>
|0| The final phase commences, channel allreserve power to Progenitor.<|endoftext|>
|1| How about that cuppa now, then?<|endoftext|>
|0| It is the Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Exterminate.<|endoftext|>
|1| Wait, wait, wait. I wouldn't if I were you. Tardisself-destruct, and you know what that means. My ship goes, you all gowith it.<|endoftext|>
|0| You would not use such a device.<|endoftext|>
|1| Try me.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. No scans. No nothing. One move and I'lldestroy us all, you got that? Tardis bang bang, Daleks boom! Good boy.This ship's pretty beaten up. Running on empty, I'd say, like you. Whenwe last met, you were at the end of your rope. Finished.<|endoftext|>
|0| One ship survived.<|endoftext|>
|1| And you fell back through time, yes. Crippled, dying.<|endoftext|>
|0| We picked up a trace. One of the Progenitor devices.<|endoftext|>
|1| Progenitor? What's that when it's at home?<|endoftext|>
|0| It is our past, and our future.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh? That's deep. That is deep for a Dalek. What does it mean,though?<|endoftext|>
|0| It contains pure Dalek DNA. Thousands were created. All werelost, save one.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay, but there's still one thing I don't get, though. Ifyou've got the Progenitor, why build Bracewell?<|endoftext|>
|0| It was necessary.<|endoftext|>
|1| But why? I get it. Oh, I get it. I get it. Oh ho! This is rich.The Progenitor wouldn't recognise you, would it? It saw you as impure.Your DNA is unrecognisable as Dalek.<|endoftext|>
|0| A solution was devised.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, yes, yes. Me. My testimony. So you set a trap. You knewthat the Progenitor would recognise me, the Daleks' greatest enemy. Itwould accept my word. My recognition of you. No. No, no. What are youdoing?<|endoftext|>
|0| Withdraw now, Doctor, or the city dies in flames.<|endoftext|>
|1| Who are you kidding? This ship is a wreck. You don't have thepower to destroy London.<|endoftext|>
|0| Watch as the humans destroy themselves.<|endoftext|>
|0| What the? No.<|endoftext|>
|0| The generators won't switch off. The lightsare on all across London, Prime Minister.<|endoftext|>
|0| Has to be them. It has to be the Daleks.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Germans can see every inch of the city. We're sittingducks. Get those lights out before the Germans get here.<|endoftext|>
|0| Confirm. Squadron two four four and fifty six mobilised.Emergency. Emergency.<|endoftext|>
|0| One oh nine? One oh nine, confirm.<|endoftext|>
|0| Thousands will die if we don't get those lights out now.<|endoftext|>
|0| German bombers sighted over the Channel, sir. ETA ten minutes,sir.<|endoftext|>
|0| Here they come. Get a message to Mister Attlee. War Cabinetmeeting at oh three hundred hours. If we're all still here.<|endoftext|>
|0| We can't just sit here. We've got to take the fight to the Daleks.<|endoftext|>
|0| How? None of our weapons are a match for theirs.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh God, we must have something.<|endoftext|>
|0| Six oh four Blenheim squadron, stand by.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh. It's staring us in the face. A gift, from the Daleks.<|endoftext|>
|1| Turn those lights off now. Turn London offor I swear I will use the Tardis self destruct.<|endoftext|>
|0| Stalemate, Doctor. Leave us and return to Earth.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, that's it. That's your great victory? You leave?<|endoftext|>
|0| Extinction is not an option. We shall return to our own time andbegin again.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, no, no. I won't let you get away this time. I won't.<|endoftext|>
|0| We have succeeded. DNA reconstruction is complete. Observe,Doctor, a new Dalek paradigm.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Progenitor has fulfilled our new destiny. Behold, therestoration of the Daleks. The resurrection of the master race.<|endoftext|>
|0| Bracewell, put the gun down.<|endoftext|>
|0| My life is a lie, and I choose to end it.<|endoftext|>
|0| In your own time, Paisley boy, because right now we need yourhelp.<|endoftext|>
|0| But those creatures, my Ironsides, they made me? I canremember things. So many things. The last war. The squalor and the mudand the awful, awful misery of it all. What am I? What am I?<|endoftext|>
|0| What you are, sir, is either on our side or theirs. Now, Idon't give a damn if you're a machine, Bracewell. Are you a man?<|endoftext|>
|0| Listen to me. I understand. Really, I do. Look, there is aspaceship up there lighting up London like a Christmas tree. Thousandsof people will die tonight if we don't stop it, and you are the onlyone who can help take it down.<|endoftext|>
|0| I am?<|endoftext|>
|0| You're alien technology. You're as clever as the Daleks are, sostart thinking. What about rockets? You got rockets? Because you saidgravity whatsits, hypersonic flight, some kind of missile.<|endoftext|>
|0| It isn't a fireworks party, Miss Pond. We need propertactical. Oh. A missile. Or.<|endoftext|>
|0| Or what?<|endoftext|>
|0| We could send something up there, you say?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, well, with a gravity bubble, yes, but. Theoreticallyit's possible that we could actually send something into space.<|endoftext|>
|0| Bracewell, it's time to think big.<|endoftext|>
|0| All hail the new Daleks. All hail the newDaleks. <|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, you are inferior.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Then prepare.<|endoftext|>
|0| We are ready.<|endoftext|>
|0| Cleanse the unclean. Total obliteration. Disintegrate.<|endoftext|>
|1| Blimey. What do you do to the ones who mess up?<|endoftext|>
|0| You are the Doctor. You must be exterminated.<|endoftext|>
|1| Don't mess with me, sweetheart.<|endoftext|>
|0| More Nazi bombers approaching in strikeformation. Incendiary bombs have hit the East End of London.<|endoftext|>
|0| At last. Are they ready?<|endoftext|>
|0| I hope so. But in the meantime, this will pick up Dalektransmissions.<|endoftext|>
|0| We are the paradigm of a new Dalek race.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's him. It's the Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Scientist, Strategist<|endoftext|>
|0| Drone, Eternal, and the Supreme.<|endoftext|>
|1| Which would be you, I'm guessing. Well, you know, nice paintjob.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'd be feeling pretty swish ifI looked like you. Pretty supreme.<|endoftext|>
|0| He's got company. New company. You've got to hurry up.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes? Right. Right, thanks. Ready when you are, PrimeMinister.<|endoftext|>
|0| Splendid.<|endoftext|>
|0| Spaceship's exact coordinates located.<|endoftext|>
|0| Go to it, Group Captain. Go to it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Broadsword to Danny Boy. Broadsword to Danny Boy. Scramble.Scramble. Scramble.<|endoftext|>
|1| Question is, what do we do now? Either youturn off your clever machine or I'll blow you and your new paradigminto eternity.<|endoftext|>
|0| And yourself.<|endoftext|>
|1| Occupational hazard.<|endoftext|>
|0| Scan reveals nothing. Tardis self destruct device non-existent.<|endoftext|>
|1| All right, it's a Jammy Dodger, but I was promised tea.<|endoftext|>
|0| Alert. Unidentified projectile approaching. Correction, multipleprojectiles.<|endoftext|>
|0| What have the humans done?<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't know.<|endoftext|>
|0| Explain. Explain. Explain.<|endoftext|>
|0| Danny Boy to the Doctor. Danny Boy to the Doctor. Are youreceiving me? Over.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh ho! Winston, you beauty.<|endoftext|>
|0| Danny Boy to the Doctor. Come in. Over.<|endoftext|>
|1| Loud and clear, Danny Boy. Big dish, sideof the ship. Blow it up. Over.<|endoftext|>
|0| Exterminate the Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| You heard him, Group Captain. Targetthat dish. Send in all we've got.<|endoftext|>
|0| Broadsword to Danny Boy. Target thedish and stop that signal. Over.<|endoftext|>
|0|. Understood, sir. Over.<|endoftext|>
|0| You can count on us. Over.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, good luck, lads.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, chaps, let's put London back undercover of darkness. Tally ho! Cover my back, going in close. Pull out,pull out.<|endoftext|>
|0| We've lost Jubilee, sir. Over.<|endoftext|>
|0| Beam still active, sir.<|endoftext|>
|0| Send them in again.<|endoftext|>
|0| Flintlock's down sir, and the dish seems tobe protected. Over.<|endoftext|>
|0| Shields intact. Pulse still active.<|endoftext|>
|0| Danny Boy to the Doctor. Only me left now.<|endoftext|>
|0| Anything you can do, sir? Over.<|endoftext|>
|1| The Doctor to Danny Boy. The Doctor to Danny Boy.<|endoftext|>
|0| I can disrupt the Dalek shields, butnot for long. Over.<|endoftext|>
|0| Good show, Doctor. Go to it. Over.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm going in. Wish me luck. Over.<|endoftext|>
|0| Shields de-activated.<|endoftext|>
|0| Energy pulse destroyed.<|endoftext|>
|0| Direct hit, sir!<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes!<|endoftext|>
|0| Thank the Lord. Do your worst, Adolf.<|endoftext|>
|0| Danny Boy to the Doctor. Going in foranother attack.<|endoftext|>
|1| The Doctor to Danny Boy. The Doctor toDanny Boy. Destroy this ship. Over.<|endoftext|>
|0| What about you, Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|1| I'll be okay.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, call off your attack.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah ha. What, and let you scuttle off back to the future? Nofear. This is the end for you. The final end.<|endoftext|>
|0| Call off the attack, or we will destroy the Earth.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm not stupid, mate. You've just played your last card.<|endoftext|>
|0| Bracewell is a bomb.<|endoftext|>
|1| You're bluffing. Deception's second natureto you. There isn't a sincere bone in your body. There isn't a bone inyour body.<|endoftext|>
|0| His power is derived from an Oblivion Continuum.Call off your attack, or we will detonate the android.<|endoftext|>
|1| No. This is my best chance ever. The last of the Daleks. I canrid the Universe of you, once and for all.<|endoftext|>
|0| Then do it. But we will shatter the planet below.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Earth will die screaming.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, and if I let you go, you'll bestronger than ever. A new race of Daleks.<|endoftext|>
|0| Then choose, Doctor. Destroy the Daleks<|endoftext|>
|0| Or save the Earth.<|endoftext|>
|0| Begin countdown of OblivionContinuum. Choose, Doctor. Choose. Choose.<|endoftext|>
|1| The Doctor to Danny Boy. The Doctor to Danny Boy. Withdraw.<|endoftext|>
|0| Say again, sir. Over.<|endoftext|>
|1| Withdraw. Return to Earth. Over and out.<|endoftext|>
|0| But sir.<|endoftext|>
|0| There's no time. You have to return to Earth now. Over.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Doctor has failed. His compassion is hisgreatest weakness. Daleks have no such weakness.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|1| Ow. Sorry, Professor, you're a bomb. An inconceivably massiveDalek bomb.<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|1| There's an Oblivion Continuum inside you. A captured wormholethat provides perpetual power. Detonate that, and the Earth will bleedthrough into another dimension. Now keep down.<|endoftext|>
|0| Detonation sequence activated. Time corridorestablishing.<|endoftext|>
|0| Time jump in thirty rels.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well?<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't know, I don't know, I don't know. Never seen one upclose before.<|endoftext|>
|0| So what, they've wired him up to detonate?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh no, not wired him up. He is a bomb. Walking, talking, pow,exploding, the moment that flashes red.<|endoftext|>
|0| There's a blue wire or something you have to cut, isn't there?There's always a blue wire. Or a red one.<|endoftext|>
|1| You're not helping.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's incredible. He talked to us about his memories. TheGreat War.<|endoftext|>
|1| Someone else's stolen thoughts, implanted in a positronicbrain. Tell me about it. Bracewell. Tell me about your life.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, I really don't think this is the time.<|endoftext|>
|1| Tell me, and prove you're human. Tell me everything.<|endoftext|>
|0| Countdown proceeding.<|endoftext|>
|0| My family ran the Post Office. It's alittle place just near the abbey, just by the ash trees. There used tobe eight trees but there was a storm.<|endoftext|>
|1| And your parents? Come on, tell me.<|endoftext|>
|1| What was that like? How did it feel? How did it make you feel,Edwin? Tell me. Tell me now.<|endoftext|>
|0| It hurt. It hurt, Doctor, it hurt so badly. It was like awound. I though it was worse than a wound. Like I'd been emptied out.There was nothing left.<|endoftext|>
|1| Good. Remember it now, Edwin. The ash trees by the Post Officeand your mum and dad, and losing them, and men in the trenches you sawdie. Remember it. Feel it. You feel it because you're human. You're notlike them. You're not like the Daleks.<|endoftext|>
|0| It hurts, Doctor. It hurts so much.<|endoftext|>
|1| Good. Good, good, brilliant. Embrace it. That means you'realive. They cannot explode that bomb because you're a human being. Youare flesh and blood. They cannot explode that bomb. Believe it. You areProfessor Edwin Bracewell, and you, my friend, are a human being.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's not working. I can't stop it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hey, Paisley. Ever fancied someone you know you shouldn't?<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|0| It hurts, doesn't it? But kind of a good hurt.<|endoftext|>
|0| I really shouldn't talk about her.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh. There's a her.<|endoftext|>
|1| What was her name?<|endoftext|>
|0| Dorabella.<|endoftext|>
|1| Dorabella? It's a lovely name. It's a beautiful name.<|endoftext|>
|0| What was she like, Edwin?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, such a smile. And her eyes. Her eyes were so blue.Almost violet, like the last touch of sunset on the edge of the world.Dorabella.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oblivion Continuum inactive.<|endoftext|>
|0| Impossible.<|endoftext|>
|0| Time jump imminent. Prepare.<|endoftext|>
|1| Welcome to the human race.<|endoftext|>
|1| You're brilliant. (Bracewell) You're brilliant. (Amy) And you,I.<|endoftext|>
|1| Now. Got to stop them. Stop the Daleks.<|endoftext|>
|0| Wait, Doctor. Wait, wait. It's too late.<|endoftext|>
|0| You will never defeat us, Doctor. We willreturn.<|endoftext|>
|0| We will return.<|endoftext|>
|0| Gone. They've gone.<|endoftext|>
|1| No. No! They can't. They can't have got away from me again.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, I can feel it. My mind is clear. The Daleks have gone.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, it's okay. You did it. You stopped the bomb. Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|1| I had a choice. And they knew I'd choose the Earth. The Dalekshave won. They beat me. They've won.<|endoftext|>
|0| But you saved the Earth. Not too shabby, is it? Is it.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, it's not too shabby.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's a brilliant achievement, my dear friend. Here, have acigar.<|endoftext|>
|1| No.<|endoftext|>
|0| So, what now, then?<|endoftext|>
|0| I still have a war to run, Miss Pond.<|endoftext|>
|0| Prime Minister.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, thank you. Oh, they hit the Palace and Saint Paul'sagain. Fire crews only just saved it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Is she okay?<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|0| She looks very upset.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, Miss Breen? Her young man didn't make it, I'm afraid.Just got word. Shot down over the Channel. Where's the Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|1| Tying up loose ends. I've taken out all the alien techBracewell put in.<|endoftext|>
|0| Won't you reconsider, Doctor? Those Spitfires would win methe war in twenty hours.<|endoftext|>
|1| Exactly.<|endoftext|>
|0| But why not? Why can't we put an end to all this misery?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, it doesn't work like that, Winston, and it's going to betough. There are terrible days to come. The darkest days. But you cando it. You know you can.<|endoftext|>
|0| Stay with us, and help us win through. The world needs you.<|endoftext|>
|1| The world doesn't need me.<|endoftext|>
|0| No?<|endoftext|>
|1| The world's got Winston Spencer Churchill.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's been a pleasure, Doctor, as always.<|endoftext|>
|1| Too right.<|endoftext|>
|0| Goodbye, Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, shall we say adieu?<|endoftext|>
|0| Indeed. Goodbye, Miss Pond.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's, it's been amazing, meeting you.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm sure it has.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oi, Churchill. Tardis key. The one you just took from the Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, she's good, Doctor. As sharp as a pin. Almost as sharpas me.<|endoftext|>
|0| K B O.<|endoftext|>
|0| I've been expecting you, Doctor. I knewthis moment had to come.<|endoftext|>
|1| Moment?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's time to de-activate me.<|endoftext|>
|1| Is it? Oh. Er, yeah.<|endoftext|>
|0| You have no choice. I'm Dalek technology. Can't allow me togo pottering around down here where I have no business.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, you're dead right, Professor. A hundred percent right. Andby the time I get back here in what, ten minutes?<|endoftext|>
|0| More like fifteen.<|endoftext|>
|1| Fifteen minutes, yeah, that's exactly what I'm going to do. Youare going to be so de-activated. It's going be like you've never evenbeen activated.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah.<|endoftext|>
|0| Fifteen minutes?<|endoftext|>
|1| More like twenty, if I'm honest. Once Pond and I see to theurgent thing we've got to see to. The, the. See?<|endoftext|>
|0| Very well, Doctor. I shall wait here and prepare myself.<|endoftext|>
|0| That Dalek tech a bit slow on the uptake. That thing we've got todo, going totake half an hour, realistically, isn't it, Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|1| Easily. So no running off, that's what I'm saying. Don't gotrying to find that little Post Office with the ash trees or that girl.What was her name?<|endoftext|>
|0| Dorabella.<|endoftext|>
|1| Dorabella. On no account go looking for her. Mind you, you canget a lot done in half an hour.<|endoftext|>
|0| Thank you. Thank you, Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| Come along, Pond.<|endoftext|>
|0| So, you have enemies then?<|endoftext|>
|1| Everyone's got enemies.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, but mine's the woman outside Budgens with the mental JackRussell. You've got, like, you know, arch-enemies.<|endoftext|>
|1| Suppose so.<|endoftext|>
|0| And here's me thinking we'd just be running through time, beingdaft and fixing stuff. But no, it's dangerous.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yep. Very. Is that a problem?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm still here, aren't I? You're worried about the Daleks.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm always worried about the Daleks.<|endoftext|>
|0| It'll take time though, won't it? I mean, there's still not manyof them. They'll need a while to build themselves up.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's not that. There's something else. Something we'veforgotten. Or rather you have.<|endoftext|>
|0| Me?<|endoftext|>
|1| You didn't know them, Amy. You'd never seen them before. Andyou should have done. You should.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's a beautiful day.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hallucinogenic lipstick. She's here.<|endoftext|>
|1| Wrong. Wrong. Bit right, mostly wrong. I love museums.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, great. Can we go to a planet now? Big space ship?Churchill's bunker? You promised me a planet next.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy, this isn't any old asteroid. It's the Delerium Archive,the final resting place of the headless monks. The biggest museumever. <|endoftext|>
|0| You've got a time machine. What do you need museums for?<|endoftext|>
|1| Wrong. Very wrong. Ooo, one of mine. Also one of mine.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, I see. It's how you keep score.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh great, an old box.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's from one of the old starliners. A Home Box.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's a Home Box?<|endoftext|>
|1| Like a black box on a plane, except it homes. Anything happensto the ship, the Home Box flies home with all the flight data.<|endoftext|>
|0| So?<|endoftext|>
|1| The writing, the graffiti. Old High Gallifreyan. The lostlanguage of the Time Lords.<|endoftext|>
|1| There were days, there were many days, these words could burnstars and raise up empires, and topple gods.<|endoftext|>
|0| What does it say?<|endoftext|>
|1| Hello, sweetie.<|endoftext|>
|0| Party's over, Doctor Song.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why are we doing this?<|endoftext|>
|1| Because someone on a spaceship twelve thousand years ago istrying to attract my attention. Let's see if we can get the securityplayback working.<|endoftext|>
|0| The party's over, Doctor Song<|endoftext|>
|0| Yet still you're on board.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry, Alistair.<|endoftext|>
|0| I needed to see what was in your vault. Doyou all know what's down there? Any of you? Because I'll tell yousomething. This ship won't reach its destination.<|endoftext|>
|0| Wait till she runs. Don't make it look like an execution.<|endoftext|>
|0| Triple seven five<|endoftext|>
|0| Slash three four nine by ten.<|endoftext|>
|0| Zero twelve slash acorn.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, and I could do with an aircorridor.<|endoftext|>
|0| What was that? What did she say?<|endoftext|>
|1| Coordinates.<|endoftext|>
|0| Like I said on the dance floor, you mightwant to find something to hang on to.<|endoftext|>
|1| Whoo!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|1| River?<|endoftext|>
|0| Follow that ship.<|endoftext|>
|0| They've gone into warp drive. We're losing them. Stay close.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm trying.<|endoftext|>
|0| Use the stabilisers.<|endoftext|>
|1| There aren't any stabilisers.<|endoftext|>
|0| The blue switches.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, the blue ones don't do anything, they're just blue.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, they're blue. Look, they're the blue stabilisers.<|endoftext|>
|0| See?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah. Well, it's just boring now, isn't it? They're boring-ers.They're blue boring-ers.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, how come she can fly the Tardis?<|endoftext|>
|1| You call that flying the Tardis? Ha!<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay. I've mapped the probability vectors, done a fold-back onthe temporal isometry, charted the ship to its destination, and parkedus right along side.<|endoftext|>
|1| Parked us? We haven't landed.<|endoftext|>
|0| Of course we've landed. I just landed her.<|endoftext|>
|1| But, it didn't make the noise.<|endoftext|>
|0| What noise?<|endoftext|>
|1| You know, the (wheezing).<|endoftext|>
|0| It's not supposed to make that noise. You leave the brakes on.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, well, it's a brilliant noise. I love that noise. Comealong, Pond. Let's have a look.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, wait. Environment checks.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh yes, sorry. Quite right. Environment checks.<|endoftext|>
|1| Nice out.<|endoftext|>
|0| We're somewhere in the Garn Belt. There's an atmosphere. Earlyindications suggest that<|endoftext|>
|1| We're on Alfava Metraxis, the seventh planet of the DundraSystem.Oxygen rich atmosphere, all toxins in the soft band, eleven hour dayand chances of rain later.<|endoftext|>
|0| He thinks he's so hot when he does that.<|endoftext|>
|0| How come you can fly the Tardis?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, I had lessons from the very best.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, yeah.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's a shame you were busy that day. Right then, why did theyland here?<|endoftext|>
|1| They didn't land.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry?<|endoftext|>
|1| You should've checked the Home Box. It crashed.<|endoftext|>
|0| Explain Who is that and how did she do that museum thing?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's a long story and I don't know most of it. Off we go.<|endoftext|>
|0| What are you doing?<|endoftext|>
|1| Leaving. She's got where she wants to go, let's go where wewant to go.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you basically running away?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yep.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why?<|endoftext|>
|1| Because she's the future. My future.<|endoftext|>
|0| Can you run away from that?<|endoftext|>
|1| I can run away from anything I like. Time is not the boss ofme.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hang on, is that a planet out there?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, of course it's a planet.<|endoftext|>
|0| You promised me a planet. Five minutes?<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay, five minutes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes!<|endoftext|>
|1| But that's all, because I'm telling you now, that woman is notdragging me into anything.<|endoftext|>
|0| What caused it to crash?<|endoftext|>
|0| Not me.<|endoftext|>
|1| Nah, the airlock would've sealed seconds after you blew it.According to the Home Box, the warp engines had a phase shift. Nosurvivors.<|endoftext|>
|0| A phase shift would have to be sabotage. I did warn them.<|endoftext|>
|1| About what?<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, at least the building was empty. Aplan temple. Unoccupiedfor centuries.<|endoftext|>
|0| Aren't you going to introduce us?<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy Pond, Professor River Song.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ah, I'm going to be a Professor some day, am I? How exciting.Spoilers.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, but who is she and how did she do that? She just left you anote in a museum.<|endoftext|>
|0| Two things always guaranteed to show up in a museum. The HomeBox of category four starliner and sooner or later, him. It's how hekeeps score.<|endoftext|>
|0| I know.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's hilarious, isn't it?<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm nobody's taxi service. I'm not going to be there to catchyou every time you feel like jumping out of a space ship.<|endoftext|>
|0| And you are so wrong. There's one survivor. There's a thing inthe belly of that ship that can't ever die. Now he's listening.<|endoftext|>
|0| You lot in orbit yet? Yeah, I saw it land. I'm at the crashsite. Try and home in on my signal. Doctor, can you sonic me? I need toboost the signal so we can use it as a beacon.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ooo, Doctor, you sonicked her.<|endoftext|>
|0| We have a minute. Shall we?<|endoftext|>
|0| Where are we up to? Have we done the Bone Meadows?<|endoftext|>
|0| What's the book?<|endoftext|>
|1| Stay away from it.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is it though?<|endoftext|>
|1| Her diary.<|endoftext|>
|0| Our diary.<|endoftext|>
|1| Her past, my future. Time travel. We keep meeting in the wrongorder.<|endoftext|>
|0| You promised me an army, Doctor Song.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, I promised you the equivalent of an army. This is theDoctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Father Octavian, Sir. Bishop, second class. Twenty clerics atmy command. The troops are already in the drop ship and landingshortly. Doctor Song was helping us with a covert investigation. HasDoctor Song explained what we're dealing with?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, what do you know of the Weeping Angels?<|endoftext|>
|0| The Angel, as far as we know, is still trapped in the ship.Our mission is to get inside and neutralise it. We can't get through uptop, we'd be too close to the drives. According to this, behind thecliff face there's a network of catacombs leading right up to thetemple. We can blow through the base of the cliffs, get into theentrance chamber, then make our way up.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, good.<|endoftext|>
|0| Good, sir?<|endoftext|>
|1| Catacombs. Probably dark ones. Dark catacombs. Great.<|endoftext|>
|0| Technically, I think it's called a maze of the dead.<|endoftext|>
|1| You can stop any time you like.<|endoftext|>
|0| Father Octavian?<|endoftext|>
|0| Excuse me, sir.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're letting people call you sir. You never do that. So,whatever a Weeping Angel is, it's really bad, yeah?<|endoftext|>
|1| Now that's interesting. You're still here. Which part of waitin the Tardis till I tell you it's safe was so confusing?<|endoftext|>
|0| Ooo, you are all Mister Grumpy Face today.<|endoftext|>
|1| A Weeping Angel, Amy, is the deadliest, most powerful, mostmalevolent life form evolution has ever produced, and right now one ofthem is trapped inside that wreckage and I'm supposed to climb in afterit with a screwdriver and a torch, and assuming I survive the radiationlong enough and assuming the whole ship doesn't explode in my face, dosomething incredibly clever which I haven't actually thought of yet.That's my day. That's what I'm up to. Any questions?<|endoftext|>
|0| Is River Song your wife? Because she's someone from your future,and the way she talks to you, I've never seen anyone do that. She'skind of like, you know, heel, boy. She's Mrs Doctor from the future,isn't she? Is shegoing to be your wife one day?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, you're right. I am definitely Mister Grumpy Face today.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor! Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oops. Her indoors.<|endoftext|>
|0| Father Octavian.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why do they call him Father?<|endoftext|>
|1| He's their Bishop, they're his Clerics. It's the fifty firstCentury. The Church has moved on.<|endoftext|>
|0| What do you think? It's from the security cameras in theByzantium vault. I ripped it when I was on board. Sorry about thequality. It's four seconds. I've put it on loop.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, it's an Angel. Hands covering its face.<|endoftext|>
|0| You've encountered the Angels before.<|endoftext|>
|1| Once, on Earth, a long time ago. But those were scavengers,barely surviving.<|endoftext|>
|0| But it's just a statue.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's a statue when you see it.<|endoftext|>
|1| Where did it come from?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, pulled from the ruins of Razbahan, end of last century. It'sbeen in private hands ever since. Dormant all that time.<|endoftext|>
|1| There's a difference between dormant and patient.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's that mean, it's a statue when you see it?<|endoftext|>
|0| The Weeping Angels can only move if they're unseen. So legendhas it.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, it's not legend, it's a quantum lock. In the sight of anyliving creature the Angels literally cease to exist. They're juststone. The ultimate defence mechanism.<|endoftext|>
|0| What, being a stone?<|endoftext|>
|1| Being a stone until you turn your back.<|endoftext|>
|1| The hyperdrive would've split on impact.That whole ship's going to be flooded with drive burn radiation,cracked electrons, gravity storms. Deadly to almost any living thing.<|endoftext|>
|0| Deadly to an Angel?<|endoftext|>
|1| Dinner to an Angel. The longer we leave it there, the strongerit will grow. Who built that temple? Are they still around?<|endoftext|>
|0| The Aplans. Indigenous life form. They died out four hundredyears ago.<|endoftext|>
|0| Two hundred years later, the planet was terraformed.Currently there are six billion human colonists.<|endoftext|>
|1| Whoo! You lot, you're everywhere. You're like rabbits. I'llnever get done saving you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sir, if there is a clear and present danger to the localpopulation<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, there is. Bad as it gets. Bishop, lock and load.<|endoftext|>
|0| Verger, how are we doing with those explosives? Doctor Song,with me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Two minutes. Sweetie, I need you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Sweetie?<|endoftext|>
|0| Anybody need me? Nobody?<|endoftext|>
|0| I found this. Definitive work on the Angels. Well, the only one.Written by a madman. It's barely readable, but I've marked a fewpassages.<|endoftext|>
|1| Not bad. Bit slow in the middle. Didn't you hate hisgirlfriend? No. No, hang on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor Song? Did you have more than one clip of the Angel?<|endoftext|>
|0| No, just the four seconds.<|endoftext|>
|1| This book is wrong. What's wrong with this book? It's wrong.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's so strange when you go all baby face. How early is this foryou?<|endoftext|>
|1| Very early.<|endoftext|>
|0| So you don't know who I am yet?<|endoftext|>
|1| How do you know who I am? I don't always look the same.<|endoftext|>
|0| I've got pictures of all your faces. You never show up in theright order, though. I need the spotter's guide.<|endoftext|>
|1| Pictures. Why aren't there pictures?<|endoftext|>
|0| But you're just a recording. You can't move.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|1| This whole book, it's a warning about theWeeping Angels, so why no pictures? Why not show us what to look outfor?<|endoftext|>
|0| There was a bit about images. What was that?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes. Hang on. (reads) That which holds the image of an angelbecomes itself an angel.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|0| What does that mean? An image of a Angelbecomes itself an Angel.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor! It's in the room!<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|1| Are you all right? What's happening?<|endoftext|>
|1| Doctor? Doctor, it's coming out of thetelevision.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Angel is here.<|endoftext|>
|1| Don't take your eyes off it. Keep looking. It can't move ifyou're looking.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's wrong?<|endoftext|>
|1| Deadlocked.<|endoftext|>
|0| There is no deadlock.<|endoftext|>
|1| Don't blink, Amy. Don't even blink.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| What are you doing?<|endoftext|>
|1| Cutting the power. It's using the screen, I'm turning thescreen off. No good, it's deadlocked the whole system.<|endoftext|>
|0| There's no deadlock.<|endoftext|>
|1| There is now.<|endoftext|>
|0| Help me!<|endoftext|>
|1| Can you turn it off?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| The screen. Can you turn it off?<|endoftext|>
|0| I tried.<|endoftext|>
|0| Try again<|endoftext|>
|1| But don't take your eyes off the Angel.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm not.<|endoftext|>
|1| Each time it moves, it'll move faster.Don't even blink.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm not blinking. Have you ever tried not blinking?<|endoftext|>
|0| It just keeps switching back on.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, it's the Angel.<|endoftext|>
|0| But it's just a recording.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, anything that takes the image of anAngel is an Angel. What are you doing?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm trying to cut through. It's not even warm.<|endoftext|>
|1| There is no way in. It's not physically possible.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, what's it going to do to me?<|endoftext|>
|1| Just keep looking at it. Don't stoplooking.<|endoftext|>
|0| Just tell me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Tell me. Tell me!<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy, not the eyes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Look at the Angel but don't look atthe eyes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why?<|endoftext|>
|0| What is it?<|endoftext|>
|1| (reads) The eyes are not the windows of the soul. They are thedoors. Beware what may enter there.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, what did you say?<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't look at the eyes!<|endoftext|>
|0| No, about images. What did you say about images?<|endoftext|>
|0| Whatever holds the image of an Angel, is anAngel.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, hold this. One, two, three, four.<|endoftext|>
|0| I froze it. There was a sort of blip on the tape and I froze it onthe blip. It wasn't the image of an Angel any more. That was good,yeah? It was, wasn't it? That was pretty good.<|endoftext|>
|0| That was amazing.<|endoftext|>
|1| River, hug Amy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why?<|endoftext|>
|1| Because I'm busy.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm fine.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're brilliant.<|endoftext|>
|0| Thanks. Yeah, I kind of creamed it, didn't I?<|endoftext|>
|0| So it was here? That was the Angel?<|endoftext|>
|1| That was a projection of the Angel. It's reaching out, gettinga good look at us. It's no longer dormant.<|endoftext|>
|0| Last one positive.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor? We're through.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay, now it starts.<|endoftext|>
|0| Coming?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, coming. There's just something in my eye.<|endoftext|>
|1| Do we have a gravity globe?<|endoftext|>
|0| Grav globe.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where are we? What is this?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's an Aplan Mortarium, sometimes called a Maze of the Dead.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's that?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, if you happen to be a creature of living stone<|endoftext|>
|1| The perfect hiding place.<|endoftext|>
|0| I guess this makes it a bit trickier.<|endoftext|>
|1| A bit, yeah.<|endoftext|>
|0| A stone Angel on the loose amongst stone statues. A lotharder than I'd prayed for.<|endoftext|>
|0| A needle in a haystack.<|endoftext|>
|1| A needle that looks like hay. A hay-like needle of death. Ahay-alike needle of death in a haystack of, er, statues. No, yours wasfine.<|endoftext|>
|0| Right. Check every single statue in this chamber. You knowwhat you're looking for. Complete visual inspection. One question. Howdo we fight it?<|endoftext|>
|1| We find it, and hope.<|endoftext|>
|0| He doesn't know yet, does he? Who and what you are.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's too early in his time stream.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, make sure he doesn't work it out, or he's not going tohelp us.<|endoftext|>
|0| I won't let you down. Believe you me, I have no intention ofgoing back to prison.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sir? Side chamber. One visible exit.<|endoftext|>
|0| Check it out. Angelo, go with him.<|endoftext|>
|0| You all right?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, I'm fine. So, what's a Maze of the Dead?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, it's not as bad as it sounds. It's just a labyrinth withdead people buried in the walls. Okay, that was fairly bad. Right giveme your arm. This won't hurt a bit.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ow!<|endoftext|>
|0| There, you see. I lied. It's a viro-stabiliser. Stabilises yourmetabolism against radiation, drive burn, anything. You're going toneed it when we get up to that ship.<|endoftext|>
|0| So what's he like? In the future, I mean. Because you know him inthe future, don't you?<|endoftext|>
|0| The Doctor? Well, the Doctor's the Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh. Well, that's very helpful. Mind if I write that down?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, we are.<|endoftext|>
|1| Sorry, what?<|endoftext|>
|0| Talking about you.<|endoftext|>
|1| I wasn't listening. I'm busy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ah. The other way up.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're so his wife.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, Amy, Amy, Amy. This is the Doctor we're talking about. Doyou really think it could be anything that simple?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yep.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're good. I'm not saying you're right, but you are very good.<|endoftext|>
|0| Can you believe this? We're huntingstatues.<|endoftext|>
|0| Better than chasing lava snakes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Actually, lava snakes weren't that bad.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who's there? Is someone there? Angelo. Angelo!<|endoftext|>
|0| Christian, is that you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Angelo, come and see this.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is it?<|endoftext|>
|0| Just come and see it.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's not a school trip. Just tell me.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, really. Come and see.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry, sorry. I thought. I thought it looked at me.<|endoftext|>
|0| We know what the Angel looks like. Is that the Angel?<|endoftext|>
|0| No, sir.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, sir, it is not. According to the Doctor, we are facing anenemy of unknowable power and infinite evil, so it would be good, itwould be very good, if we could all remain calm in the presence ofdecor.<|endoftext|>
|1| What's your name?<|endoftext|>
|0| Bob, sir.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah, that's a great name. I love Bob.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's a Sacred Name. We all have Sacred Names. They're givento us in the service of the Church.<|endoftext|>
|1| Sacred Bob. More like Scared Bob now, eh?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, sir.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah, good. Scared keeps you fast. Anyone in this room who isn'tscared is a moron. Carry on.<|endoftext|>
|0| We'll be moving into the maze in two minutes. You stay withChristian and Angelo. Guard the approach.<|endoftext|>
|0| Isn't there a chance this lot's just going tocollapse? There's a whole ship up there.<|endoftext|>
|0| Incredible builders, the Aplans.<|endoftext|>
|1| Had dinner with their Chief Architect once. Two heads arebetter than one.<|endoftext|>
|0| What, you mean you helped him?<|endoftext|>
|1| No, I mean he had two heads. That book, the very end, what didit say?<|endoftext|>
|0| Hang on.<|endoftext|>
|1| Read it to me.<|endoftext|>
|0| What if we had ideas that could think for themselves? What ifone day our dreams no longer needed us? When these things occur and areheld to be true, the time will be upon us. The time of Angels.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hey, Angelo, Christian, where are you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Are we there yet? It's a hell of a climb.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Maze is on six levels, representing the ascent of the soul.Only two levels to go.<|endoftext|>
|1| Lovely species, the Aplans. We should visit them some time.<|endoftext|>
|0| I thought they were all dead?<|endoftext|>
|1| So is Virginia Woolf. I'm on her bowling team. Very relaxed,sort of cheerful. Well, that's having two heads, of course. You'renever short of a snog with an extra head.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, there's something. I don't know what it is.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, there's something wrong. Don't know what it is yet,either. Working on it. Of course, then they started having laws againstself-marrying. I mean, what was that about? But that's the Church foryou. Er, no offence, Bishop.<|endoftext|>
|0| Quite a lot taken, if that's all right, Doctor. Lowest pointin the wreckage is only about fifty feet up from here. That way.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Church had a point, if you think about it. The divorces musthave been messy.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's wrong?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh.<|endoftext|>
|1| Exactly.<|endoftext|>
|0| How could we have not noticed that?<|endoftext|>
|1| Low level perception filter, or maybe we're thick.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's wrong, sir?<|endoftext|>
|1| Nobody move. Nobody move. Everyone stay exactly where they are.Bishop, I am truly sorry. I've made a mistake and we are all interrible danger.<|endoftext|>
|0| What danger?<|endoftext|>
|0| The Aplans.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Aplans?<|endoftext|>
|0| They've got two heads.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, I get that. So?<|endoftext|>
|1| So why don't the statues? Everyone, over there. Just move.Don't ask questions, don't speak.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay, I want you all to switch off your torches.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sir?<|endoftext|>
|1| Just do it. Okay. I'm going to turn off this one too, just fora moment.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you sure about this?<|endoftext|>
|1| No.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, my God. They've moved.<|endoftext|>
|1| They're Angels. All of them.<|endoftext|>
|0| But they can't be.<|endoftext|>
|1| Clerics, keep watching them.<|endoftext|>
|1| Every statue in this Maze, every single one, is a WeepingAngel. They're coming after us.<|endoftext|>
|0| Bob, come and see this.<|endoftext|>
|0| Angelo?<|endoftext|>
|0| Come and see what we've found.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you with Christian? The Bishop said you'd be five minutes.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm here, Bob. Come and see this.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where are you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Through the arch, Bob. Honestly, you've got to come andsee this.<|endoftext|>
|0| What have you found?<|endoftext|>
|0| Come and see.<|endoftext|>
|0| No. What is it?<|endoftext|>
|0| Come and see.<|endoftext|>
|0| But there was only one Angel on the ship.Just the one, I swear.<|endoftext|>
|0| Could they have been here already?<|endoftext|>
|1| The Aplans. What happened? How did they die out?<|endoftext|>
|0| Nobody knows.<|endoftext|>
|1| We know.<|endoftext|>
|0| They don't look like Angels.<|endoftext|>
|0| And they're not fast. You said they were fast. They should havehad us by now.<|endoftext|>
|1| Look at them. They're dying, losing their form. They must havebeen down here for centuries, starving.<|endoftext|>
|0| Losing their image?<|endoftext|>
|1| And their image is their power. Power. Power!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|1| Don't you see? All that radiation spilling out the drive burn.The crash of the Byzantium wasn't an accident, it was a rescue missionfor the Angels. We're in the middle of an army, and it's waking up.<|endoftext|>
|0| We need to get out of here fast.<|endoftext|>
|0| Bob, Angelo, Christian, come in, please. Any of you, come in.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's Bob, sir. Sorry, sir.<|endoftext|>
|0| Bob, are Angelo and Christian with you? All the statues areactive. I repeat, all the statues are active.<|endoftext|>
|0| I know, sir. Angelo and Christian are dead, sir. The statueskilled them, sir.<|endoftext|>
|1| Bob, Sacred Bob, it's me, the Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm talking to<|endoftext|>
|1| Where are you now?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm talking to my<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, shut up.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm on my way up to you, sir. I'm homing in on your signal.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah, well done, Bob. Scared keeps you fast. Told you, didn't I.Your friends, Bob. What did the Angel do to them?<|endoftext|>
|0| Snapped their necks, sir.<|endoftext|>
|1| That's odd. That's not how the Angels kill you. They displaceyou in time. Unless they needed the bodies for something.<|endoftext|>
|0| Bob, did you check their data packs for vital signs? We maybe able to initiate a rescue plan.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, don't be an idiot. The Angels don't leave you alive. Bob,keep running. But tell me, how did you escape?<|endoftext|>
|0| I didn't escape, sir. The Angel killed me, too.<|endoftext|>
|1| What do you mean, the Angel killed you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Snapped my neck, sir. Wasn't as painless as I expected, butit was pretty quick, so that was something.<|endoftext|>
|1| If you're dead, how can I be talking to you?<|endoftext|>
|0| You're not talking to me, sir. The Angel has no voice. Itstripped my cerebral cortex from my body and re-animated a version ofmy consciousness to communicate with you. Sorry about the confusion.<|endoftext|>
|1| So when you say you're on your way up to us<|endoftext|>
|0| It's the Angel that's coming, sir, yes. No way out.<|endoftext|>
|0| Then we get out through the wreckage. Go! Go, go, go. All ofyou run.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm coming. Just go. Go, go, go. Yeah. Calledyou an idiot. Sorry, but there's no way we could have rescued your men.<|endoftext|>
|0| I know that, sir. And when you've flown away in your littleblue box, I'll explain that to their families.<|endoftext|>
|1| Angel Bob. Which Angel am I talking to? The one from the ship?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, sir. And the other Angels are still restoring.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah, so the Angel is not in the wreckage. Thank you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Don't wait for me. Go, run.<|endoftext|>
|0| I can't. No, really, I can't.<|endoftext|>
|1| Why not?<|endoftext|>
|0| Look at it. Look at my hand. It's stone.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well. There it is, the Byzantium.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's got to be thirty feet. How do we get up there?<|endoftext|>
|0| Check all these exits. I want them all secure.<|endoftext|>
|1| You looked into the eyes of an Angel,didn't you?<|endoftext|>
|0| I couldn't stop myself. I tried.<|endoftext|>
|1| Listen to me. It's messing with your head. Your hand is notmade of stone.<|endoftext|>
|0| It is. Look at it.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's in your mind, I promise you. You can move that hand. Youcan let go.<|endoftext|>
|0| I can't, okay? I've tried and I can't. It's stone.<|endoftext|>
|1| The Angel is going to come and it's going to turn this lightoff, and then there's nothing I can do to stop it, so do it.Concentrate. Move your hand.<|endoftext|>
|0| I can't.<|endoftext|>
|1| Then we're both going to die.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're not going to die.<|endoftext|>
|1| They'll kill the lights.<|endoftext|>
|0| You've got to go. You know you have. You've got all that stuffwith River and that's all got to happen. You know you can't die here.<|endoftext|>
|1| Time can be re-written. It doesn't work like that.<|endoftext|>
|1| Keep your eyes on it. Don't blink.<|endoftext|>
|0| Run!<|endoftext|>
|1| You see, I'm not going. I'm not leaving you here.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't need you to die for me, Doctor. Do I look that clingy?<|endoftext|>
|1| You can move your hand.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's stone.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's not stone.<|endoftext|>
|0| You've got to go. Those people up there will die without you. Ifyou stay here with me, you'll have as good as killed them.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy Pond, you are magnificent, and I'm sorry.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, no, I'm not leaving you, never. I'm sorry about this.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ow!<|endoftext|>
|1| See? Not stone. Now run.<|endoftext|>
|0| You bit me.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, and you're alive.<|endoftext|>
|0| Look, I've got a mark. Look at my hand.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, and you're alive. Did I mention?<|endoftext|>
|0| Blimey, your teeth. Have you got space teeth?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah. Alive. All I'm saying.<|endoftext|>
|0| The statues are advancing along allcorridors. And, sir, my torch keeps flickering.<|endoftext|>
|0| They all do.<|endoftext|>
|0| So does the gravity globe.<|endoftext|>
|0| Clerics, we're down to four men. Expect incoming.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, it's the Angels. They're coming. And they're draining thepower for themselves.<|endoftext|>
|0| Which means we won't be able to see them.<|endoftext|>
|1| Which means we can't stay here.<|endoftext|>
|0| Two more incoming.<|endoftext|>
|0| Any suggestions?<|endoftext|>
|0| The statues are advancing on all sides. We don't have theclimbing equipment to reach the Byzantium.<|endoftext|>
|0| There's no way up, no way back, no way out. No pressure, butthis is usually when you have a really good idea.<|endoftext|>
|1| There's always a way out.<|endoftext|>
|0| There's always a way out. There's always a way out.<|endoftext|>
|1| There's always a way out.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor? Can I speak to the Doctor, please?<|endoftext|>
|1| Hello, Angels. What's your problem?<|endoftext|>
|0| Your power will not last much longer, and the Angels will bewith you shortly. Sorry, sir.<|endoftext|>
|1| Why are you telling me this?<|endoftext|>
|0| There's something the Angels are very keen you should knowbefore the end.<|endoftext|>
|1| Which is?<|endoftext|>
|0| I died in fear.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm sorry?<|endoftext|>
|0| You told me my fear would keep me alive, but I died afraid,in pain and alone. You made me trust you, and when it mattered, you letme down.<|endoftext|>
|0| What are they doing?<|endoftext|>
|0| They're trying to make him angry.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm sorry, sir. The Angels were very keen for you to knowthat.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well then, the Angels have made their second mistake becauseI'm not going to let that pass. I'm sorry you're dead, Bob, but I swearto whatever is left of you, they will be sorrier.<|endoftext|>
|0| But you're trapped, sir, and about to die.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah. I'm trapped. And you know what? Speaking of traps, thistrap has got a great big mistake in it. A great big, whopping mistake.<|endoftext|>
|0| What mistake, sir?<|endoftext|>
|1| Trust me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah.<|endoftext|>
|1| Trust me?<|endoftext|>
|0| Always.<|endoftext|>
|1| You lot, trust me?<|endoftext|>
|0| Sir, two more incoming.<|endoftext|>
|0| We have faith, sir.<|endoftext|>
|1| Then give me your gun. I'm about to do something incrediblystupid and dangerous. When I do, jump!<|endoftext|>
|0| Jump where?<|endoftext|>
|1| Just jump, high as you can. Come on, leap of faith, Bishop. Onmy signal.<|endoftext|>
|0| What signal?<|endoftext|>
|1| You won't miss it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry, can I ask again? You mentioned a mistake we made.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, big mistake. Huge. Didn't anyone every tell you there's onething you never put in a trap? If you're smart, if you value yourcontinued existence, if you have any plans about seeing tomorrow, thereis one thing you never, ever put in a trap.<|endoftext|>
|0| And what would that be, sir?<|endoftext|>
|1| Me.<|endoftext|>
|1| Up. Look up.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you okay?<|endoftext|>
|0| What happened?<|endoftext|>
|0| We jumped.<|endoftext|>
|0| Jumped where?<|endoftext|>
|1| Up. Up. Look up.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where are we?<|endoftext|>
|0| Exactly where we were.<|endoftext|>
|0| No we're not.<|endoftext|>
|1| Move your feet.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, what am I looking at? Explain.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, come on, Amy, think. The ship crashed with the power stillon, yeah? So what else is still on?<|endoftext|>
|1| The artificial gravity. One good jump, and up we fell. Shot outthe grav globe to give us an updraft, and here we are.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, the statues. They look more like Angels now.<|endoftext|>
|1| They're feeding on the radiation from the wreckage, drainingall the power from the ship, restoring themselves. Within an hour,they'll be an army.<|endoftext|>
|1| They're taking out the lights. Look at them. Look at theAngels. Into the ship, now. Quickly, all of you.<|endoftext|>
|0| How?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|1| It's just a corridor. The gravity orientates to the floor. Now,in here, all of you. Don't take your eyes off the Angels. Move, move,move.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, men. Go, go, go!<|endoftext|>
|0| The Angels. Presumably they can jump up too?<|endoftext|>
|1| They're here, now. In the dark, we're finished.<|endoftext|>
|1| Run!<|endoftext|>
|0| This whole place is a death trap.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, it's a time bomb. Well, it's a death trap and a time bomb.And now it's a dead end. Nobody panic. Oh, just me then. What's throughhere?<|endoftext|>
|0| Secondary flight deck.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay. so we've basically run up the inside of a chimney, yeah? Sowhat if the gravity fails?<|endoftext|>
|1| I've thought about that.<|endoftext|>
|0| And?<|endoftext|>
|1| And we'll all plunge to our deaths. See? I've thought about it.The security protocols are still live. There's no way to override them.It's impossible.<|endoftext|>
|0| How impossible?<|endoftext|>
|1| Two minutes.<|endoftext|>
|0| The hull is breached and the power's failing.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sir, incoming.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor? Lights.<|endoftext|>
|0| Clerics, keep watching them.<|endoftext|>
|1| And don't look at their eyes. Anywhere else. Not the eyes. I'veisolated the lighting grid. They can't drain the power now.<|endoftext|>
|0| Good work, Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes. Good, good, good. Good in many ways. Good you like it sofar.<|endoftext|>
|0| So far?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, there's only one way to open this door. I guess I'll needto route all the power in this section through the door control.<|endoftext|>
|0| Good. Fine. Do it.<|endoftext|>
|1| Including the lights. All of them. I'll need to turn out thelights.<|endoftext|>
|0| How long for?<|endoftext|>
|1| Fraction of a second. Maybe longer. Maybe quite a bit longer.<|endoftext|>
|0| Maybe?<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm guessing. We're being attacked by statues in a crashedship. There isn't a manual for this.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, we lost the torches. We'll be in total darkness.<|endoftext|>
|1| No other way. Bishop.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor Song, I've lost good Clerics today. You trust thisman?<|endoftext|>
|0| I absolutely trust him.<|endoftext|>
|0| He's not some kind of madman, then?<|endoftext|>
|0| I absolutely trust him.<|endoftext|>
|1| Excuse me.<|endoftext|>
|0| (sotto) I'm taking your word, because you're the only one whocan manage this guy. But that only works so long as he doesn't know whoyou are. You cost me any more men, and I might just tell him.Understood?<|endoftext|>
|0| Understood.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, Doctor. We've got your back.<|endoftext|>
|1| Bless you. Bishop.<|endoftext|>
|0| Combat distance, ten feet. As soon as the lights go down,continuous fire. Full spread over the hostiles. Do not stop firingwhile the lights are out. Shot gun protocol. We don't have bullets towaste.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy, when the lights go down, the wheel should release. Spin itclockwise four turns.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ten.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, four. Four turns.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, four. I heard you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ready!<|endoftext|>
|0| On my count, then. God be with us all. Three, two, one, fire!<|endoftext|>
|1| Turn!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, it's opening. It's working.<|endoftext|>
|1| Fall back!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, quickly.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor! What are you doing?<|endoftext|>
|0| Magnetized the door. Nothing could turn that wheel now.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah?<|endoftext|>
|0| Dear God!<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah, now you're getting it. You've bought us time though. That'sgood. I am good with time.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Seal that door. Seal it now.<|endoftext|>
|0| We're surrounded.<|endoftext|>
|0| Seal it. Seal that door. Doctor, how long have we got?<|endoftext|>
|1| Five minutes, max.<|endoftext|>
|0| Nine.<|endoftext|>
|1| Five.<|endoftext|>
|0| Five. Right. Yeah.<|endoftext|>
|1| Why'd you say nine?<|endoftext|>
|0| I didn't.<|endoftext|>
|0| We need another way out of here.<|endoftext|>
|0| There isn't one.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, there is. Course there is. This is a galaxy class ship.Goes for years between planet falls. So, what do they need?<|endoftext|>
|0| Of course.<|endoftext|>
|0| Of course what? What do they need?<|endoftext|>
|0| Can we get in there?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, it's a sealed unit, but they must have installed itsomehow. This whole wall should slide up. There's clamps. Release theclamps.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's through there? What do they need?<|endoftext|>
|0| They need to breathe.<|endoftext|>
|0| But that's. That's a.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's an oxygen factory.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's a forest.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, it's a forest. It's an oxygen factory.<|endoftext|>
|1| And if we're lucky, an escape route.<|endoftext|>
|0| Eight.<|endoftext|>
|0| What did you say?<|endoftext|>
|0| Nothing.<|endoftext|>
|1| Is there another exit? Scan the architecture, we don't havetime to get lost in there.<|endoftext|>
|0| On it. Stay where you are until I've checked the Rad levels.<|endoftext|>
|0| But trees, on a space ship?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, more than trees. Way better than trees. You're going tolove this. Treeborgs. Trees plus technology. Branches become cablesbecome sensors on the hull. A forest sucking in starlight, breathingout air. It even rains. There's a whole mini-climate. This vault is anecopod running right through the heart of the ship. A forest in abottle on a space ship in a maze. Have I impressed you yet, Amy Pond?<|endoftext|>
|0| Seven.<|endoftext|>
|1| Seven?<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry, what?<|endoftext|>
|1| You said seven.<|endoftext|>
|0| No. I didn't.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes. you did.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, there's an exit, far end of the ship, into thePrimary Flight Deck.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, good. That's where we need to go.<|endoftext|>
|0| Plotting a safe path now.<|endoftext|>
|1| Quick as you like.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor? Excuse me? Hello, Doctor? Angel Bob here, sir.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah. There you are, Angel Bob. How's life? Sorry, bad subject.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Angels are wondering what you hope to achieve.<|endoftext|>
|1| Achieve? We're not achieving anything. We're just hanging. It'snice in here. Consoles, comfy chairs, a forest. How's things with you?<|endoftext|>
|0| The Angels are feasting, sir. Soon we will be able to absorbenough power to consume this vessel, this world. and all the stars andworlds beyond.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, we've got comfy chairs. Did I mention?<|endoftext|>
|0| We have no need of comfy chairs.<|endoftext|>
|1| I made him say comfy chairs.<|endoftext|>
|0| Six.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay, Bob, enough chat. Here's what I want to know. What haveyou done to Amy?<|endoftext|>
|0| There is something in her eye.<|endoftext|>
|1| What's in her eye?<|endoftext|>
|0| We are.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's he talking about? Doctor, I'm five. I mean, five. Fine! I'mfine.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're counting.<|endoftext|>
|0| Counting?<|endoftext|>
|0| Why?<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't know.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, counting down to what?<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't know.<|endoftext|>
|0| We shall take her. We shall take all of you. We shall havedominion over all time and space.<|endoftext|>
|1| Get a life, Bob. Oops, sorry again. There's power on this ship,but nowhere near that much.<|endoftext|>
|0| With respect, sir, there's more power on this ship than youyet understand.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's that? Dear God, what is it?<|endoftext|>
|0| They're back.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's hard to put in your terms, Doctor Song, but as best Iunderstand it, the Angels are laughing.<|endoftext|>
|1| Laughing?<|endoftext|>
|0| Because you haven't noticed yet, sir. The Doctor in theTardis hasn't noticed.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| No. Wait. There's something I've missed.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's, that's, that's like the crack from my bedroom wall fromwhen I was a little girl.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes. Two parts of space and time that should never havetouched.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, enough. We're moving out.<|endoftext|>
|0| Agreed. Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, fine.<|endoftext|>
|0| What are you doing?<|endoftext|>
|1| Right with you.<|endoftext|>
|0| We're not leaving without you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh yes, you are. Bishop?<|endoftext|>
|0| Miss Pond, Doctor Song, now!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|0| Come on!<|endoftext|>
|1| So, what are you? Oh, that's bad. Ah, that's extremely very notgood.<|endoftext|>
|1| Do not blink.<|endoftext|>
|1| Argh!<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy? Amy, what's wrong?<|endoftext|>
|1| Why am I not dead then?<|endoftext|>
|1| Good, and not so good. Oh, this isn't even a little bit good. Imean, is that it? Is that the power that brought you here? That's pureTime Energy. You can't feed on that. That's now power, that's the fireat the end of the universe. I'll tell you something else.<|endoftext|>
|1| Never let me talk!<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy, what's wrong?<|endoftext|>
|0| Four.<|endoftext|>
|0| Med scanner, now.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor Song, we can't stay here. We've got to keep moving.<|endoftext|>
|0| We wait for the Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Our mission is to make this wreckage safe and neutralise theAngels. Until that is achieved<|endoftext|>
|0| Father Octavian, when the Doctor's in the room, your one andonly mission is to keep him alive long enough to get everyone elsehome. And trust me, it's not easy. Now, if he's dead back there, I'llnever forgive myself. And if he's alive, I'll never forgive him. And,Doctor, you're standing right behind me, aren't you?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, yeah.<|endoftext|>
|0| I hate you.<|endoftext|>
|1| You don't. Bishop, the Angels are in the forest.<|endoftext|>
|0| We need visual contact on every line of approach.<|endoftext|>
|0| How did you get past them?<|endoftext|>
|1| I found a crack in the wall and told them it was the end of theuniverse.<|endoftext|>
|0| What was it?<|endoftext|>
|1| The end of the universe. Let's have a look, then.<|endoftext|>
|0| So, what's wrong with me?<|endoftext|>
|0| Nothing. You're fine.<|endoftext|>
|1| Everything. You're dying.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, you're right. If we lie to her, she'll get all better.Right. Amy, Amy, Amy. What's the matter with Amelia? Something's in hereye. What does that mean? Does it mean anything?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| Busy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Scared.<|endoftext|>
|1| Course you're scared. You're dying. Shut up.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, let him think.<|endoftext|>
|1| What happened? She stared at the Angel. She looked into theeyes of an Angel for too long<|endoftext|>
|0| Sir! Angel incoming.<|endoftext|>
|0| And here.<|endoftext|>
|0| Keep visual contact. Do not let it move.<|endoftext|>
|1| Come on, come on, come on. Wakey, wakey. She watched an Angelclimb out of the screen. She stared at the Angel and, and<|endoftext|>
|0| The image of an Angel is an Angel.<|endoftext|>
|1| A living mental image in a living human mind. But we stare atthem to stop them getting closer. We don't even blink, and that isexactly what they want. Because as long as our eyes are open, they canclimb inside. There's an Angel in her mind.<|endoftext|>
|0| Three. Doctor, it's coming. I can feel it. I'm going to die.<|endoftext|>
|1| Please just shut up. I'm thinking. Now, counting. What's thatabout? Bob, why are they making her count?<|endoftext|>
|0| To make her afraid, sir.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay, but why? What for?<|endoftext|>
|0| For fun, sir.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, what's happening to me? Explain.<|endoftext|>
|1| Inside your head, in the vision centres of your brain, there'san Angel. It's like there's a screen, a virtual screen inside your mindand the Angel is climbing out of it, and it's coming to shut you off.<|endoftext|>
|0| Then what I do?<|endoftext|>
|1| If it was a real screen, what would we do? We'd pull the plug.We'd kill the power. But we can't just knock her out, the Angel wouldjust take over.<|endoftext|>
|0| Then what? Quickly.<|endoftext|>
|1| We've got to shut down the vision centres of her brain. We'vegot to pull the plug. Starve the Angel.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, she's got seconds.<|endoftext|>
|1| How would you starve your lungs?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'd stop breathing.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy, close your eyes.<|endoftext|>
|0| No. No, I don't want to.<|endoftext|>
|1| Good, because that's not you, that's the Angel inside you. It'safraid. Do it. Close your eyes.<|endoftext|>
|0| She's normalising. Oh, you did it. You did it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sir? Two more incoming.<|endoftext|>
|0| Three more over here.<|endoftext|>
|0| Still weak. Dangerous to move her.<|endoftext|>
|0| So, can I open my eyes now?<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy, listen to me. If you open your eyes now for more than asecond, you will die. The Angel is still inside you. We haven't stoppedit, we've just sort of paused it. You've used up your countdown. Youcannot open your eyes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, we're too exposed here. We have to move on.<|endoftext|>
|1| We're too exposed everywhere. And Amy can't move. And anyway,that's not the plan.<|endoftext|>
|0| There's a plan?<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't know yet. I haven't finished talking. Right! Father,you and your Clerics, you're going to stay here, look after Amy. Ifanything happens to her, I'll hold every single one of you personallyresponsible, twice. River, you and me, we're going to find the PrimaryFlight Deck which is<|endoftext|>
|1| A quarter of a mile straight ahead, and from there we're goingto stabilise the wreckage, stop the Angels, and cure Amy.<|endoftext|>
|0| How?<|endoftext|>
|1| I'll do a thing.<|endoftext|>
|0| What thing?<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't know. It's a thing in progress. Respect the thing.Moving out!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, I'm coming with you. My Clerics'll look after MissPond. These are my best men. They'd lay down their lives in herprotection.<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't need you.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't care. Where Doctor Song goes, I go.<|endoftext|>
|1| What? You two engaged or something?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, in a manner of speaking. Marco, you're in charge till Iget back.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sir.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor? Please, can't I come with you?<|endoftext|>
|0| You'd slow us down, Miss Pond.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't want to sound selfish, but you'd really speed me up.<|endoftext|>
|1| You'll be safer here. We can't protect you on the move. I'll beback for you soon as I can, I promise.<|endoftext|>
|0| You always say that.<|endoftext|>
|1| I always come back. Good luck, everyone. Behave. Do not letthat girl open her eyes. And keep watching the forest. Stop thoseAngels advancing. Amy, later. River, going to need your computer!<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah. Later.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy, you need to start trusting me. It's never been moreimportant.<|endoftext|>
|0| But you don't always tell me the truth.<|endoftext|>
|1| If I always told you the truth, I wouldn't need you to trustme.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, the crack in my wall. How can it be here?<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't know yet, but I'm working it out. Now, listen. Rememberwhat I told you when you were seven?<|endoftext|>
|0| What did you tell me?<|endoftext|>
|1| No. No, that's not the point. You have to remember.<|endoftext|>
|0| Remember what? Doctor? Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|0| What's that?<|endoftext|>
|1| Er, readings from a crack in the wall.<|endoftext|>
|0| How can a crack in the wall be the end of the universe?<|endoftext|>
|1| Don't know, but here's what I think. One day there's going tobe a very big bang. So big every moment in history, past and future,will crack.<|endoftext|>
|0| Is that possible? How?<|endoftext|>
|1| How can you be engaged, in a manner of speaking?<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, sucker for a man in uniform.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor Song's in my personal custody. I released her from theStormcage Containment Facility four days ago and I am legallyresponsible for her until she's accomplished her mission and earned herpardon. Just so we understand each other.<|endoftext|>
|1| You were in Stormcage?<|endoftext|>
|0| What? What is that?<|endoftext|>
|1| The date. The date of the explosion, where the crack begins.<|endoftext|>
|0| And for those of us who can't read the base code of theuniverse?<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy's time.<|endoftext|>
|0| So, what's happening? Anything happening out there?<|endoftext|>
|0| The Angels are still grouping. Are you getting this too?<|endoftext|>
|0| The trees? Yeah.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's wrong with the trees?<|endoftext|>
|0| Here too, sir. They're ripping the Treeborgs apart.<|endoftext|>
|0| And here. They're taking out the lights.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is it? What's happening? Tell me. I can't see.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's the trees. ma'am. The trees are going out.<|endoftext|>
|0| It doesn't open it from here, but it'sthe Primary Flight Deck. This has got to be a service hatch orsomething.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hurry up and open it. Time's running out.<|endoftext|>
|1| What? What did you say? Time's running out, is that what yousaid?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah. I just meant<|endoftext|>
|1| I know what you meant. Hush. But what if it could?<|endoftext|>
|0| What if what could?<|endoftext|>
|1| Time. What if time could run out?<|endoftext|>
|0| Got it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Angels advancing, sir.<|endoftext|>
|0| Over here again.<|endoftext|>
|0| Weapons primed. Combat distance five feet. Wait for it.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is it? What's happening? Just tell me!<|endoftext|>
|0| Keep your position and, ma'am, keep your eyes shut. Wait.<|endoftext|>
|0| The ship's not on fire. is it?<|endoftext|>
|0| It can't be. the compressors would have taken care of it. Marco,the Angels have gone. Where'd they go?<|endoftext|>
|0| What, the Angels?<|endoftext|>
|0| This side's clear too, sir.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Angels have gone?<|endoftext|>
|0| There's still movement out there, but away from us now. It'slike they're running.<|endoftext|>
|0| Running from what?<|endoftext|>
|0| Phillip, Crispin, need to get a closer look at that.<|endoftext|>
|0| What are you all looking at? What's there?<|endoftext|>
|1| Cracks. Cracks in time. Time running out.No, couldn't be. Couldn't be. But how is a duck pond a duck pond ifthere aren't any ducks? And she didn't recognise the Daleks. Okay, timecan shift. Time can change. Time can be rewritten. Ah. Oh!<|endoftext|>
|0| It's like, I don't know, a curtain ofenergy, sort of shifting. Makes you feel weird. Sick.<|endoftext|>
|0| And you think it scared the Angels?<|endoftext|>
|0| What could scare those things?<|endoftext|>
|0| What are you doing?<|endoftext|>
|0| Point me at the light.<|endoftext|>
|0| You can't open your eyes.<|endoftext|>
|0| I can't open them for more than a second, that's what the Doctorsaid. Still got a bit of countdown left.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ma'am. you can't.<|endoftext|>
|0| I need to see it. Am I looking the right way? I have to be quick.<|endoftext|>
|0| Very quick.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's the same shape. It's the crack in my wall.<|endoftext|>
|0| Close your eyes, now.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's following me! How can it be following me?<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you okay?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah. It was the same shape.<|endoftext|>
|0| Marco, you want me to get a closer look at that?<|endoftext|>
|0| Go for it. Don't get too close.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hang on. What about the other two? Why not just wait until they'reback?<|endoftext|>
|0| What other two?<|endoftext|>
|0| The ones you sent before.<|endoftext|>
|0| I didn't send anyone before.<|endoftext|>
|0| You did, I heard you. Crispin and Phillip.<|endoftext|>
|0| Crispin and who?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor Song, get through, now. Doctor?Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| Time can be unwritten.<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy, there never was a Crispin or a Phillipon this mission, I promise you.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, I heard you. Before you sent Pedro, you sent Crispin andPhillip, and now you can't even remember them. Something happened. Idon't know what, and you don't even remember.<|endoftext|>
|0| Pedro?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, before you sent Pedro.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who's Pedro?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's been happening all around me and Ihaven't even noticed.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, we have to move.<|endoftext|>
|1| The CyberKing. A giant Cyberman walks over all of VictorianLondon and no one remembers.<|endoftext|>
|0| We have to move it. The Angels could be here any second.<|endoftext|>
|1| Never mind the Angels. There's worse here than Angels.<|endoftext|>
|0| I beg to differ, sir.<|endoftext|>
|1| Let him go.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, it can't let me go, sir, can it? Not while you'relooking at it.<|endoftext|>
|1| I can't stop looking at it, it'll kill you.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's going to kill me anyway. Think it through. There's noway out of this. You have to leave me.<|endoftext|>
|1| Can't you wriggle out?<|endoftext|>
|0| No, it's too tight. You have to leave me, sir. There'snothing you can do.<|endoftext|>
|0| Something's happening. Pedro was here a secondago and now you can't even remember him.<|endoftext|>
|0| There never was a Pedro. There's only ever been the two of ushere.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, there were five of us. Why can't you remember?<|endoftext|>
|0| Listen. Listen. I need to get a closer look at that light,whatever it is. Don't worry, I won't get too close.<|endoftext|>
|0| No. No, you can't. You mustn't.<|endoftext|>
|0| Here. Spare communicator. I'll stay in touch the whole time.<|endoftext|>
|0| You won't, because if you go back there what happened to theothers will happen to you.<|endoftext|>
|0| There weren't any others.<|endoftext|>
|0| There won't be any you if you go back there.<|endoftext|>
|0| Two minutes. I promise.<|endoftext|>
|0| Please, just listen to me!<|endoftext|>
|0| Sir, there's nothing you can do.<|endoftext|>
|1| You're dead if I leave you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes. Yes, I'm dead. And before you go<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm not going.<|endoftext|>
|0| Listen to me, it's important. You can't trust her.<|endoftext|>
|1| Trust who?<|endoftext|>
|0| River Song. You think you know her, but you don't. You don'tunderstand who or what she is.<|endoftext|>
|1| Then tell me.<|endoftext|>
|0| I've told you more than I should. Now please, you have to go.It's your duty to your friends.<|endoftext|>
|1| Just tell me why she was in Stormcage?<|endoftext|>
|0| She killed a man. A good man. A hero to many.<|endoftext|>
|1| Who?<|endoftext|>
|0| You don't want to know, sir. You really don't.<|endoftext|>
|1| Who did she kill?<|endoftext|>
|0| Sir, the Angels are coming. You have to leave me.<|endoftext|>
|1| You'll die.<|endoftext|>
|0| I will die in the knowledge that my courage did not desert meat the end. For that I thank God, and bless the path that takes you tosafety.<|endoftext|>
|1| I wish I'd known you better.<|endoftext|>
|0| I think, sir, you know me at my best.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ready?<|endoftext|>
|0| Content.<|endoftext|>
|0| There's a teleport. If I can get it to work.we can beam the others here. Where's Octavian?<|endoftext|>
|1| Octavian's dead. So is that teleport. You're wasting your time.I'm going to need your communicator.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello? Are you there? Hello? Hello? <|endoftext|>
|0| I'm here. I'm fine. Quite close to it now.<|endoftext|>
|0| Then come back. Come back now, please.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's weird looking at it. It feels really<|endoftext|>
|0| Really what? Hello? Really what? Hello? Hello? Hello? Please sayyou're there. Hello? Hello?<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy? Amy? Is that you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|1| Where are you? Are the Clerics with you?<|endoftext|>
|0| They've gone.<|endoftext|>
|0| There was a light and they walked into thelight. Doctor, they didn't even remember each other.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, they wouldn't.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is that light?<|endoftext|>
|1| Time running out. Amy, I'm sorry, I made a mistake. I shouldnever have left you there.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, what do I do now?<|endoftext|>
|1| You come to us. The Primary Flight Deck,the other end of the forest.<|endoftext|>
|0| I can't see. I can't open my eyes.<|endoftext|>
|1| Turn on the spot.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry, what?<|endoftext|>
|1| Just do it. Turn on the spot.<|endoftext|>
|0| When the communicator sounds like myscrewdriver, that means you're facing the right way. Follow the sound.You have to start moving now. There's Time Energy<|endoftext|>
|1| Spilling out of that crack, and you have tostay ahead of it.<|endoftext|>
|0| But the Angels, they're everywhere.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm sorry, I really am, but the Angels canonly kill you.<|endoftext|>
|0| What does the Time Energy do?<|endoftext|>
|1| Just keep moving!<|endoftext|>
|0| Tell me.<|endoftext|>
|1| If the Time Energy catches up with you,you'll never have been born. It will erase every moment<|endoftext|>
|0| Of your existence. You will never havelived at all.<|endoftext|>
|1| Now, keep your eyes shut and keep moving.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's never going to work.<|endoftext|>
|1| What else have you got! River! Tell me!<|endoftext|>
|0| What's that?<|endoftext|>
|1| The Angels running from the fire. They came here to feed on theTime Energy, now it's going to feed on them. Amy, listen to me.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm sending a bit of software to yourcommunicator. It's a proximity detector. it'll beep if there'ssomething in your way. You just manoeuvre till the beeping stops.<|endoftext|>
|1| Because, Amy, this is important.<|endoftext|>
|0| The forest is full of Angels.<|endoftext|>
|1| You're going to have to walk like you cansee.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, what do you mean?<|endoftext|>
|0| Look, just keep moving.<|endoftext|>
|0| That Time Energy, what's it going to do?<|endoftext|>
|1| Er, keep eating.<|endoftext|>
|0| How do we stop it?<|endoftext|>
|1| Feed it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Feed it what?<|endoftext|>
|1| A big, complicated space time event should shut it up for awhile.<|endoftext|>
|0| Like what, for instance?<|endoftext|>
|1| Like me, for instance!<|endoftext|>
|0| What's that?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's a warning. There are Angels round younow.<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy, listen to me. This is going to behard but I know<|endoftext|>
|1| You can do it. The Angels are scared<|endoftext|>
|0| And running, and right now they're notthat interested in you. They'll assume you can see them and theirinstincts will kick in. All you've got to do is walk like you can see.<|endoftext|>
|1| Just don't open your eyes. Walk like youcan see. You're not moving. You have to do this. Now. You have to dothis!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor? I can't find the communicator. I dropped it. I can't findit, Doctor. Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor. Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't open your eyes. You're on the Flight Deck. The Doctor'shere. I teleported you. See? Told you I could get it working.<|endoftext|>
|1| River Song, I could bloody kiss you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ah well, maybe when you're older.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's that?<|endoftext|>
|1| The Angels are draining the last of the ship's power, whichmeans the shield's going to release.<|endoftext|>
|1| Angel Bob, I presume.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Time Field is coming. It will destroy our reality.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, and look at you all, running away. What can I do for you?<|endoftext|>
|0| There is a rupture in time. The Angels calculate that if youthrow yourself into it, it will close, and they will be saved.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, yeah, yeah. Could do, could do that. But why?<|endoftext|>
|0| Your friends will also be saved.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, there is that.<|endoftext|>
|0| I've travelled in time. I'm a complicated space time event too.Throw me in.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, be serious. Compared to me, these Angels are morecomplicated than you, and it would take every one of them to amount tome, so get a grip.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, I can't let you do this.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, seriously, get a grip.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're not going to die here!<|endoftext|>
|1| No, I mean it. River, Amy, get a grip.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, you genius.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sir, the Angels need you to sacrifice yourself now.<|endoftext|>
|1| Thing is, Bob, the Angels are draining all the power from thisship. Every last bit of it. And you know what? I think they'veforgotten where they're standing. I think they've forgotten the gravityof the situation. Or to put it another way, Angels.<|endoftext|>
|0| (to Amy) You hold on tight and don't you let go for anything.<|endoftext|>
|1| Night, night.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ah. Bruised everywhere.<|endoftext|>
|1| Me too.<|endoftext|>
|0| You didn't have to climb out with your eyes shut.<|endoftext|>
|1| Neither did you. I kept saying. The Angels all fell into theTime Field. The Angel in your memory never existed. It can't harm younow.<|endoftext|>
|0| Then why do I remember it at all? Those guys on the ship didn'tremember each other.<|endoftext|>
|1| You're a time traveller now. Amy. It changes the way you seethe universe, forever. Good, isn't it?<|endoftext|>
|0| And the crack, is that gone too?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, for now. But the explosion that caused it is stillhappening. Somewhere out there, somewhere in time.<|endoftext|>
|0| You, me, handcuffs. Must it always end this way?<|endoftext|>
|1| What now?<|endoftext|>
|0| The prison ship's in orbit. They'll beam me up any second. Imight have done enough to earn a pardon this time. We'll see.<|endoftext|>
|1| Octavian said you killed a man.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, I did.<|endoftext|>
|1| A good man.<|endoftext|>
|0| A very good man. The best man I've ever known.<|endoftext|>
|1| Who?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's a long story. Doctor. It can't be told, it has to be lived.No sneak previews. Well, except for this one. You'll see me again quitesoon, when the Pandorica opens.<|endoftext|>
|1| The Pandorica. Ha! That's a fairy tale.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, aren't we all? I'll see you there.<|endoftext|>
|1| I look forward to it.<|endoftext|>
|0| I remember it well.<|endoftext|>
|0| Bye, River.<|endoftext|>
|0| See you, Amy. Oh, I think that's my ride.<|endoftext|>
|1| Can I trust you. River Song?<|endoftext|>
|0| If you like. Ha, but where's the fun in that?<|endoftext|>
|0| What are you thinking?<|endoftext|>
|1| Time can be rewritten.<|endoftext|>
|0| I want to go home.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, not like that. I just, I just want to show you something.You're running from River. I'm running too.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah.<|endoftext|>
|1| Blimey.<|endoftext|>
|0| I know. This is the same night we left, yeah?<|endoftext|>
|1| We've been gone five minutes.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm getting married in the morning.<|endoftext|>
|1| Why did you leave it here?<|endoftext|>
|0| Why did I leave my engagement ring when I ran away with a strangeman the night before my wedding?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hmm. You really are an alien, aren't you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Who's the lucky fellow?<|endoftext|>
|0| You met him.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah, the good looking one. Or the other one?<|endoftext|>
|0| The other one.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, he was good too.<|endoftext|>
|0| Thanks. So, do you comfort a lot of people on the night beforetheir wedding?<|endoftext|>
|1| Why would you need comforting?<|endoftext|>
|0| I nearly died. I was alone in the dark, and I nearly died. And itmade me think.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, yes, natural. I think sometimes. Well, lots of times.<|endoftext|>
|0| About what I want. About who I want. You know what I mean?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah. No.<|endoftext|>
|0| About who I want.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh right, yeah. No, still not getting it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor. In a word. In one very simple word even you canunderstand.<|endoftext|>
|1| No! You're getting married in the morning!<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, the morning's a long time away. What are we going to doabout that?<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy, listen to me. I am nine hundred and seven years old. Doyou understand what that means?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's been a while?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah. No, no, no. I'm nine hundred and seven, and look at me. Idon't get older, I just change. You get older, I don't, and this can'tever work.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, you are sweet. Doctor. But I really wasn't suggesting anythingquite so long term.<|endoftext|>
|1| But you're human. You're Amy. You're getting married in themorning. In the morning.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's you. It's all about you. Everything. It's about you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hold that thought.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy Pond. Mad, impossible, Amy Pond. I don't know why, I haveno idea, but quite possibly the single most important thing in thehistory of the universe is that I get you sorted out right now.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's what I've been trying to tell you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Come on.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| And for those of us who can't read the base code of theuniverse?<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy's time.<|endoftext|>
|0| Signora, your school offers a chance for betterment, escape. Mydaughter. Isabella is seventeen now, but what prospects are there forthe daughter of a boat builder? There's no future for us. No future butyou.<|endoftext|>
|0| I am moved by your concern for your daughter. I believeprotecting the future of one's own is a sacred duty.<|endoftext|>
|0| Signora, she is my world.<|endoftext|>
|0| Then we will take your world.<|endoftext|>
|0| I knew it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Say goodbye to your daughter.<|endoftext|>
|0| Now, signora?<|endoftext|>
|0| Why wait? Time ticks.<|endoftext|>
|0| Be brave, my girl. Make me proud.<|endoftext|>
|0| Step into the light, my dear. That's it.<|endoftext|>
|0| What say you, Francesco? Do you like her?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, I do, Mother. I do.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hey! It's me. Hello. How are you?<|endoftext|>
|0| The reason for this call is because I haven't told you forseven hours that I love you, which is a scandal, and even if we weren'tgetting married tomorrow, I'd ask you to marry me anyway.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, I would, because you are smashing.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh. Oh. Oh, blimey. I've. I've, er got to go. I'll see youtomorrow.<|endoftext|>
|0| Out. Out. Out.<|endoftext|>
|1| Rory! That's a relief. I thought I'd burst out of the wrongcake, again. That reminds me, there's a girl standing outside in abikini. Could someone let her in and give her a jumper? Lucy? Lovelygirl. Diabetic. Now then, Rory. We need to talk about yourfiancée. She tried to kiss me. Tell you what, though. You're a luckyman. She's a great kisser.<|endoftext|>
|1| Funny how you can say something in your head and it soundsfine.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, the life out there, it dazzles. I mean, it blinds you tothe things that are important. I've seen it devour relationships andplans. It's meant to do that. Because for one person to have seen allthat, to taste the glory and then go back, it will tear you apart. So,I'm sending you somewhere, together.<|endoftext|>
|0| Whoa. What, like a date?<|endoftext|>
|1| Anywhere you want. Any time you want. One condition. It has tobe amazing. The Moulin Rouge in 1890. The first Olympic Games. Think ofit as a wedding present, because it's either this or tokens. It's a lotto take in, isn't it? Tiny box, huge room inside. What's that about?Let me explain.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's another dimension.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's basically another dimension. What?<|endoftext|>
|0| After what happened with Prisoner Zero, I've been reading up onall the latest scientific theories. FTL travel, parallel universes.<|endoftext|>
|1| I like the bit when someone says it's bigger on the inside. Ialways look forward to that.<|endoftext|>
|0| So, this date. I'm kind of done with running down corridors. Whatdo you think, Rory?<|endoftext|>
|1| How about somewhere romantic?<|endoftext|>
|1| Venice.<|endoftext|>
|1| Venezia. La Serenissima. Impossible city. Preposterous city.Founded by refugees running from Attila the Hun. It was just acollection of little wooden huts in the middle of the marsh, but becameone of the most powerful cities in the world. Constantly being invaded,constantly flooding, constantly just beautiful. Ah, you got to loveVenice. So many people did. Byron, Napoleon, Casanova. Ooo, thatreminds me. 1580. That's all right. Casanova doesn't get born for ahundred and forty five years. Don't want to run into him. I owe him achicken.<|endoftext|>
|0| You owe Casanova a chicken?<|endoftext|>
|1| Long story. We had a bet.<|endoftext|>
|0| Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Papers, if you please. Proofof residency, current bill of medical inspection.<|endoftext|>
|1| There you go, fellow. All to your satisfaction, I think you'llfind.<|endoftext|>
|0| I am so sorry, Your Holiness. I didn't realise.<|endoftext|>
|1| No worries. You were just doing your job. Sorry, what exactlyis your job?<|endoftext|>
|0| Checking for aliens. Visitors from foreign lands what mightbring the plague with them.<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't worry, Viscountess. No, we're under quarantine here.No one comes in, no one goes out, and all because of the grace andwisdom of our patron, Signora Rosanna Calvierri.<|endoftext|>
|1| How interesting. I heard the plague died out years ago.<|endoftext|>
|0| Not out there. No, Signora Calvierri has seen it with herown eyes. Streets are piled high with bodies, she said.<|endoftext|>
|1| Did she now.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oi.<|endoftext|>
|0| Er, according to this, I am your eunuch.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh yeah. I'll explain later.<|endoftext|>
|0| Veils down, girls.<|endoftext|>
|0| (sotto) The Calvierri girls.<|endoftext|>
|0| What do you want?<|endoftext|>
|0| Where's my Isabella?<|endoftext|>
|0| What are you doing? Get away from there.<|endoftext|>
|0| Isabella? Isabella, it's me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Girls, come along.<|endoftext|>
|0| She's gone.<|endoftext|>
|0| Isabella! It's me!<|endoftext|>
|0| What was that about?<|endoftext|>
|0| Isabella!<|endoftext|>
|0| I hate it when he does that.<|endoftext|>
|1| Who are those girls?<|endoftext|>
|0| I thought everyone knew about the Calvierri school.<|endoftext|>
|1| My first day here. It's okay. Parents do all sorts of things toget their children into good schools. They move house, they changereligion. So why are you trying to get her out?<|endoftext|>
|0| Something happens in there. Something magical, something evil.My own daughter didn't recognise me. And the girl who pushed me away,her face, like an animal.<|endoftext|>
|1| I think it's time I met this Signora Calvierri.<|endoftext|>
|0| Mother?<|endoftext|>
|0| Mummy's hydrating, Francesco.<|endoftext|>
|0| And we never interrupt Mummy when she's hydrating.<|endoftext|>
|0| We were accosted again. A man made a grab for one of thegirls. The longer we wait, the greater the risk of discovery. I mean,we've already converted more than enough. Surely it's time to introducethem to my brothers?<|endoftext|>
|0| I shall decide when we have enough.<|endoftext|>
|0| If it's more you want, let me take the girls into the citytonight. We could<|endoftext|>
|0| We follow the plan. Let them hammer on our door. Beg to betaken.<|endoftext|>
|0| And what have you been doing?<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, running, and fighting. I've been scared. More scared than Ithought was<|endoftext|>
|0| Did you miss me?<|endoftext|>
|0| I knew I'd be coming back.<|endoftext|>
|0| He was right. It blots out everything else.<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory, this is our date. Let's not do this. Not now.<|endoftext|>
|0| Huh. We are in Venice and it is 1580.<|endoftext|>
|0| I know.<|endoftext|>
|0| Flowers, signor?<|endoftext|>
|0| What was that?<|endoftext|>
|0| She'll be okay. Where are you? Amy, come back!<|endoftext|>
|0| You have my daughter. Isabella!<|endoftext|>
|0| No, you're not coming in. Just stop there. Look, we've told you.<|endoftext|>
|0| You have my daughter. Isabella! I demand you let me see mydaughter.<|endoftext|>
|0| Go away.<|endoftext|>
|0| Isabella, it's me. It's your father.<|endoftext|>
|0| We will arrest you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Isabella!<|endoftext|>
|0| Give it up, will you. Move off.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hello, handsome.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who are you?<|endoftext|>
|1| How are you doing that? I am loving it. You're like Houdini,only five slightly scary girls, and he was shorter. Will be shorter.I'm rambling.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'll ask you again, signor. Who are you?<|endoftext|>
|1| Why don't you check this out?<|endoftext|>
|1| Library card. Of course, it's with. He's. I need a spare. Pale,creepy girls who don't like sunlight and can't be seen. Ha. Am Ithinking what I think I'm thinking? But the city. Why shut down thecity? Unless<|endoftext|>
|0| Leave now, signor, or we shall call for the Steward, if youare lucky.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ooo.<|endoftext|>
|1| Tell me the whole plan. (sotto) One day that will work. Listen,I would love to stay here. This whole thing. I'm thrilled. Oh, this isChristmas.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|1| I just met some vampires.<|endoftext|>
|0| We just saw a vampire.<|endoftext|>
|1| And creepy girls and everything.<|endoftext|>
|0| Vampires.<|endoftext|>
|0| We think we just saw a vampire.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know. Amy was just telling me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, yeah. The Doctor actually went to their house.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh. Right. Well.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay. So, first we need to get back in there somehow.<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|0| How do we do that?<|endoftext|>
|0| Back in where?<|endoftext|>
|1| Come and meet my new friend.<|endoftext|>
|0| As you saw, there's no clear way in. The House of Calvierri islike a fortress. But there's a tunnel underneath it, with a ladder andshaft that leads up into the house. I tried to get in once myself, butI hit a trapdoor.<|endoftext|>
|0| You need someone on the inside.<|endoftext|>
|1| No.<|endoftext|>
|0| You don't even know what I was going to say.<|endoftext|>
|1| Er, that we pretend you're an applicant for the school to getyou inside, and tonight you come down and open the trapdoor to let usin.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh. So you do know what I was going to say.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you insane?<|endoftext|>
|0| We don't have another option.<|endoftext|>
|0| He said no, Amy. Listen to him.<|endoftext|>
|0| There is another option.<|endoftext|>
|0| I work at the Arsenale. We build the warships for the navy.<|endoftext|>
|1| Gunpowder. Most people just nick stationery from where theywork. Look, I have a thing about guns and huge quantities of explosive.<|endoftext|>
|0| What do you suggest, then? We wait until they turn her into ananimal?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'll be there three, four hours, tops.<|endoftext|>
|1| No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. It can't keephappening like this. This is how they go. But I have to know. We gotogether, say you're my daughter.<|endoftext|>
|0| What? Don't listen to him.<|endoftext|>
|0| Your daughter? You look about nine.<|endoftext|>
|1| Brother, then.<|endoftext|>
|0| Too weird. Fiancé.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm not having him run around telling people he's your fiancé.<|endoftext|>
|0| No. No, you're right.<|endoftext|>
|0| Thank you.<|endoftext|>
|0| I mean, they've already seen the Doctor. You should do it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Me?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah. You can be my brother.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why is him being your brother weird, but with me, it's okay?<|endoftext|>
|0| Actually, I thought you were her fiancé.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, that's not helping.<|endoftext|>
|0| This whole thing is mental. They're vampires, for God's sake.<|endoftext|>
|1| We hope.<|endoftext|>
|0| So if they're not vampires?<|endoftext|>
|1| Makes you wonder what could be so bad it doesn't actually mindus thinking it's a vampire.<|endoftext|>
|0| So, basically, both of our parents are dead from getting theplague. I'm a gondola driver, so money's a bit tight, so having mysister go to your school for special people would be brilliant. Cheers.<|endoftext|>
|0| Have we met?<|endoftext|>
|0| I've just got one of those faces.<|endoftext|>
|0| I wasn't talking to you.<|endoftext|>
|0| She's got the same face, which is because she's my sister.<|endoftext|>
|0| Carlo, explain yourself. Why have you brought me thisimbecile?<|endoftext|>
|0| Signora, they have references from His Majesty the King ofSweden.<|endoftext|>
|0| What? Let me see.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, now I see what got my Steward so excited. What say you,Francesco? Do you like her?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, I do, Mother. I do.<|endoftext|>
|0| Then we would be delighted to accept her. Say goodbye to yoursister.<|endoftext|>
|0| Tell Uncle Doctor I'll see you both really soon, okay? I'll befine.<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy.<|endoftext|>
|0| There are clothes on the bed. Get changed and wait here.<|endoftext|>
|0| Blimey. This is private education, then?<|endoftext|>
|0| Hey. Hello, I'm Amy. What's your name?<|endoftext|>
|0| Isabella.<|endoftext|>
|0| Listen, we're going to get you out of here, but I need you to tellme what's going on. What is this place? What are they doing?<|endoftext|>
|0| They er, they come at night. They gather around my bed, andthey take me to a room with this green light and a chair with straps,as if for a surgeon.<|endoftext|>
|0| What happens in there?<|endoftext|>
|0| I wake up here. And the sunlight burns my skin like candlewax.<|endoftext|>
|1| She'll be fine.<|endoftext|>
|0| You can promise me that, can you?<|endoftext|>
|0| We're here.<|endoftext|>
|1| Right. Okay, I'll go first. If anythinghappens to me, go back<|endoftext|>
|0| What happened, between you and Amy? You said she kissed you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Now? You want to do this now?<|endoftext|>
|0| I have a right to know. I'm getting married in four hundred andthirty years.<|endoftext|>
|1| She was frightened. I was frightened. But we survived, youknow, and the relief of it, and so she kissed me.<|endoftext|>
|0| And you kissed her back.<|endoftext|>
|1| No. I kissed her mouth.<|endoftext|>
|0| Funny.<|endoftext|>
|1| Rory. Rory, she kissed me because I was there. It would havebeen you. It should have been you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, it should have been me.<|endoftext|>
|1| Exactly. That's why I brought you here.<|endoftext|>
|1| Can we go and see the vampires now, please?<|endoftext|>
|0| Control yourself, child.<|endoftext|>
|0| Take your hands off me!<|endoftext|>
|0| Psychic paper. Did you really think that would work on me?<|endoftext|>
|1| Push. Come on. There we are. Amy. Where's Amy? Amy?<|endoftext|>
|0| I can't see a thing. Just as well I brought this, then.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ultraviolet. Portable sunlight.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yours is bigger than mine.<|endoftext|>
|1| Let's not go there.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where are you from? Did you fall throughthe Chasm?<|endoftext|>
|0| Mother this is pointless. Let's just start the process and<|endoftext|>
|0| Hold your tongue, Francesco. I need to know what this girl isdoing in a world of savages with psychic paper. Who are you with? Yousee, I scarcely believe your idiot brother sent you. What are you doingin my school?<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, I'll tell you. I'm from Ofsted.<|endoftext|>
|0| (laughs) Put her in the chair.<|endoftext|>
|0| No! Take your hands off me!<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, make sport of me, will you? Tease me as if I were yourdog? Well, this dog has a bite, girl.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|0| If we cancel now, we lose the deposit on thevillage hall. The salsa band. Oh.<|endoftext|>
|0| What happened to them?<|endoftext|>
|1| They've had all the moisture taken out of them.<|endoftext|>
|0| Mother, where you drink from her, may weshare? I'm so thirsty.<|endoftext|>
|0| Of course, darling.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's what vampires do, right? They drinkyour blood and replace it with their own.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, except these people haven't just had their blood taken,but all the water in their entire bodies.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why did they die? Why aren't they like the girls in the school?<|endoftext|>
|1| Maybe not everyone survives the process.<|endoftext|>
|0| You know what's dangerous about you? It's not that you makepeople take risks, it's that you make them want to impress you. Youmake it so they don't want to let you down. You have no idea howdangerous you make people to themselves when you're around.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who are you?<|endoftext|>
|1| We should run. Run.<|endoftext|>
|0| This is how it works. First, we drink youuntil you're dry. Then we fill you with our blood. It rages through youlike a fire, changing you, until one morning you awake and yourhumanity is a dream now faded.<|endoftext|>
|0| Or you die. That can happen.<|endoftext|>
|0| And if I survive?<|endoftext|>
|0| Then there are ten thousand husbands waiting for you in thewater.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, sorry, I'm kind of engaged.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh! Rory, come on.<|endoftext|>
|1| Cab for Amy Pond?<|endoftext|>
|0| She bit me.<|endoftext|>
|0| This rescue plan. Not exactly watertight, is it?<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah ha!<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory.<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Quickly, through here.<|endoftext|>
|0| Seal the house.<|endoftext|>
|0| They're not vampires.<|endoftext|>
|1| What?<|endoftext|>
|0| I saw them. I saw her. They're not vampires, they're aliens.<|endoftext|>
|1| Classic.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's good news? What is wrong with you people?<|endoftext|>
|1| Come on, Rory. Move.<|endoftext|>
|1| Keep moving. Come on, guys.<|endoftext|>
|0| Quickly, quickly. Get out. Quick. Quick.<|endoftext|>
|1| Come on. Run.<|endoftext|>
|0| I can't.<|endoftext|>
|0| Is he dead?<|endoftext|>
|0| No, he's breathing.<|endoftext|>
|0| And so in memory of the children lost to the Silence, thetraitor is delivered to the arms of those she betrayed.<|endoftext|>
|0| Do you expect me to drown? I'm Venetian. I can swim. We canall swim.<|endoftext|>
|0| Something touched my leg! They're all around me. They bite!<|endoftext|>
|0| Now leave us.<|endoftext|>
|0| Mother, change your form, or my brothers will think they arebeing fed twice today.<|endoftext|>
|0| Not long now. It's not long.<|endoftext|>
|1| Long way from Saturnyne, aren't you, Sister of the Water?<|endoftext|>
|0| No, let me guess. The owner of the psychic paper. Then I takeit you're a refugee, like me?<|endoftext|>
|1| I'll make you a deal. An answer for an answer. You're using aperception filter. It doesn't change your features, but manipulates thebrainwaves of the person looking at you. But seeing one of you for thefirst time in, say, a mirror, the brain doesn't know what to fill thegap with, so leaves it blank, hence no reflection.<|endoftext|>
|0| Your question?<|endoftext|>
|1| Why can we see your big teeth?<|endoftext|>
|0| Self preservation over rides the mirage. The subconsciousperceives the threat and tries to alert the conscious brain.<|endoftext|>
|1| Where's Isabella?<|endoftext|>
|0| My turn. Where are you from?<|endoftext|>
|1| Gallifrey.<|endoftext|>
|0| You should be in a museum. Or in a mausoleum.<|endoftext|>
|1| Why are you here?<|endoftext|>
|0| We ran from the Silence. Why are you here?<|endoftext|>
|1| Wedding present. The Silence?<|endoftext|>
|0| There were cracks. Some were tiny. Some were as big as thesky. Through some we saw worlds and people, and through others we sawSilence and the end of all things. We fled to an ocean like ours, andthe crack snapped shut behind us. Saturnyne was lost.<|endoftext|>
|1| So Earth is to become Saturnyne Mark Two?<|endoftext|>
|0| And you can help me. We can build a new society here, asothers have. What do you say?<|endoftext|>
|1| Where's Isabella?<|endoftext|>
|0| Isabella?<|endoftext|>
|1| The girl who saved my friend.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, deserters must be executed. Any general will tell youthat. I need an answer, Doctor. A partnership. Any which way youchoose.<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't think that's such a good idea, do you? I'm a Time Lord.You're a big fish. Think of the children.<|endoftext|>
|0| Carlo? You're right. We're nothing alike. I will bend theheavens to save my race, while you philosophise.<|endoftext|>
|1| This ends today. I will tear down the House of Calvierri, stoneby stone. Take your hands off me, Carlo. And you know why? You didn'tknow Isabella's name. You didn't know Isabella's name.<|endoftext|>
|0| Open the gates.<|endoftext|>
|0| Attend. Attend. The storm is coming.<|endoftext|>
|0| Argh!<|endoftext|>
|0| Mummy, what's wrong with your perception filter?<|endoftext|>
|0| The idiot child must have damaged it when she kicked me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Now, assemble the girls. I have a job for them.<|endoftext|>
|1| You're fine. Open wide.<|endoftext|>
|1| Argh. I need to think. Come on, brain. Think, think, think.Think.<|endoftext|>
|0| If they're fish people, it explains why they hate the sun.<|endoftext|>
|1| Stop talking. Brain thinking. Hush.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's the school thing I don't understand.<|endoftext|>
|1| Stop talking. Brain thinking. Hush.<|endoftext|>
|0| I say we take the fight to them.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah, ah, ah.<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah. Her planet dies, so they flee through a crack in space andtime and end up here. Then she closes off the city and, one by one,starts changing the people into creatures like her to start a new genepool. Got it. But then what? They come from the sea. They can't survivefor ever on land, so what's she going to do? Unless she's going to dosomething to the environment to make the city habitable. She said, Ishall bend the heavens to save my race. Bend the heavens. Bend theheavens. She's going to sink Venice.<|endoftext|>
|0| She's going to sink Venice?<|endoftext|>
|1| And repopulate it with the girls she's transformed.<|endoftext|>
|0| You can't repopulate somewhere with just women. You need blokes.<|endoftext|>
|0| She's got blokes.<|endoftext|>
|1| Where?<|endoftext|>
|0| In the canal. She said to me there are ten thousand husbandswaiting in the water.<|endoftext|>
|1| Only the male offspring survived the journey here. She's gotten thousand children swimming around the canals, waiting for Mum tomake them some compatible girlfriends. Urgh. I mean, I've been around abit, but really that's, that's eugh.<|endoftext|>
|1| The people upstairs are very noisy.<|endoftext|>
|0| There aren't any people upstairs.<|endoftext|>
|1| Do you know, I knew you were going to say that. Did anyone elseknow he was going to say that?<|endoftext|>
|0| Is it the vampires?<|endoftext|>
|1| Like I said, they're not vampires. Fish from space.<|endoftext|>
|0| Aren't we on the second floor?<|endoftext|>
|0| What's happened to them?<|endoftext|>
|1| There's nothing left of them. They've been fully converted.Blimey, fish from space have never been so buxom. Okay, move.<|endoftext|>
|0| Come on.<|endoftext|>
|0| Give me the lamp.<|endoftext|>
|1| Go, go, go, guys. Keep moving. Go, go, go.<|endoftext|>
|0| Stay away from the door, Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| No. Guido, What are you doing?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm not leaving you. What are you doing?<|endoftext|>
|1| Argh, bolted.<|endoftext|>
|0| Come on. That's it, keep coming. Come on.<|endoftext|>
|1| Guido!<|endoftext|>
|0| Come on. Come on. Come on.<|endoftext|>
|0| We are Venetians!<|endoftext|>
|0| Right. To begin, let's fill the sky withfire.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| In sight of the Lord, protect and keep us.<|endoftext|>
|1| Rosanna's initiating the final phase.<|endoftext|>
|0| We need to stop her. Come on.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, no, no. Get back to the Tardis.<|endoftext|>
|0| You can't stop her on your own.<|endoftext|>
|1| We don't discuss this. I tell you to do something, Amy, and youdo it. Huh?<|endoftext|>
|0| Thank you.<|endoftext|>
|1| You're welcome.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh my God, what is going on?<|endoftext|>
|0| The sky, it's like it's boiling.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're too late. Such determination, just to save one city.Hard to believe it's the same man that let an entire race turn tocinders and ash. Now you can watch as my people take their new kingdom.<|endoftext|>
|1| The girls have gone, Rosanna.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're lying.<|endoftext|>
|1| Shouldn't I be dead, hmm? Rosanna, please, help me. There aretwo hundred thousand people in this city.<|endoftext|>
|0| So save them.<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy, run.<|endoftext|>
|0| This way, you freak. No! This way, you big, stupid, greatSpongeBob. The only thing I've seen uglier than you is your Mum.<|endoftext|>
|0| Huh?<|endoftext|>
|0| No.<|endoftext|>
|0| Did you just say something about Mummy?<|endoftext|>
|0| Careful. Careful. Okay, hit him. This way. bring him this way.Rory!<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh. Oh, you stink of fish.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, I'm hardly going to smell of cheese and biscuits.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hey, Mummy's boy!<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh.<|endoftext|>
|0| That was lucky. Why did you make the sign of the cross, younumpty?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh. Oh, right, I'm being reviewed now, am I?<|endoftext|>
|0| Mmm. Now we go help the Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Righty-ho.<|endoftext|>
|0| Open the gate!<|endoftext|>
|0| It's the Almighty. Look at the sky!<|endoftext|>
|1| Get out. I need to stabilise the storm.<|endoftext|>
|0| We're not leaving you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Right, so one minute it's all you make people a danger tothemselves, and the next it's we're not leaving you. But if one of yougets squashed or blown up or eaten, who gets the<|endoftext|>
|0| What was that?<|endoftext|>
|1| Nothing. Bit of an earthquake.<|endoftext|>
|0| An earthquake?<|endoftext|>
|1| Manipulate the elements, it can trigger earthquakes. But don'tworry about them.<|endoftext|>
|0| No?<|endoftext|>
|1| No. Worry about the tidal waves caused by the earthquake.Right, Rosanna's throne is the control hub but she's locked theprogramme, so, tear out every single wire and circuit in the throne. Gocrazy. Hit it with a stick, anything. We need it to shut down andre-route control to the secondary hub, which I'm guessing will also bethe generator.<|endoftext|>
|1| Shut up. Shut up. That's better.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh. Oh. Okay.<|endoftext|>
|0| There he is. Come on.<|endoftext|>
|0| Come on.<|endoftext|>
|0| Come on.<|endoftext|>
|0| You did it!<|endoftext|>
|1| Rosanna!<|endoftext|>
|0| One city to save an entire species. Was that so much to ask?<|endoftext|>
|1| I told you, you can't go back and change time. You mourn, butyou live. I know, Rosanna. I did it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Tell me, Doctor. Can your conscience carry the weight ofanother dead race? Remember us. Dream of us.<|endoftext|>
|1| No! No!<|endoftext|>
|1| Now then, what about you two, eh? Next stop Leadworth RegistryOffice. Maybe I can give you away.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's fine. Drop me back where you found me. I'll just say you've<|endoftext|>
|0| Stay. With us. Please. Just for a bit. I want you to stay.<|endoftext|>
|1| Fine with me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah? Yes, I would like that.<|endoftext|>
|0| Nice one. I will pop the kettle on. Hey, look at this. Got myspaceship, got my boys. My work here is done.<|endoftext|>
|0| Er, we are not her boys.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, we are.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, we are.<|endoftext|>
|1| Rory, listen to that.<|endoftext|>
|0| Er, what? All I can hear is silence.<|endoftext|>
|0| There were cracks. Through some we saw Silence and theend of all things. <|endoftext|>
|0| Rory!<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory, it's starting!<|endoftext|>
|0| Ah. Okay, okay.<|endoftext|>
|0| False alarm.<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, I don't know what it feels like. I've never had a babybefore.<|endoftext|>
|0| No.<|endoftext|>
|0| I know, leaf blowers. Use a rake.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, it's.<|endoftext|>
|0| I knew. I just knew.<|endoftext|>
|1| Rory!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| I've crushed your flowers.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, Amy will kill you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Where is she?<|endoftext|>
|0| She'll need a bit longer.<|endoftext|>
|1| Whenever you're ready, Amy.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, way-hey! You've swallowed a planet.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm pregnant.<|endoftext|>
|1| You're huge.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, I'm pregnant.<|endoftext|>
|1| Look at you. When worlds collide.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, I'm pregnant.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, look at you both. Five years later and you haven't changeda bit, apart from age and size.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, it's good to see you, Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| Are you pregnant?<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah, Leadworth. Vibrant as ever.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's Upper Leadworth, actually. We've gone slightly upmarket.<|endoftext|>
|1| Where is everyone?<|endoftext|>
|0| This is busy. Okay, it's quiet, but it's really restful andhealthy. Loads of people here live well into their nineties.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, don't let that get you down.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's not getting me down.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, I wanted to see how you were. You know me, I don't justabandon people when they leave the Tardis. This Time Lord's for life.You don't get rid of your old pal the Doctor so easily.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hmm. You came here by mistake, didn't you?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, bit of a mistake. But look, what a result. Look at thisbench. What a nice bench. What will they think of next? So. What do youdo around hereto stave off the, you know<|endoftext|>
|0| Boredom.<|endoftext|>
|1| Self harm.<|endoftext|>
|0| We relax.<|endoftext|>
|1| (silent) Relax.<|endoftext|>
|0| We live. We listen to the birds.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, see? Birds. Those are nice.<|endoftext|>
|0| We didn't get time to listen to birdsong back in the Tardis days,did we?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh blimey, my head's a bit. Ooo. Er, no, you're right, therewasn't a lot of time for birdsong back in the good old<|endoftext|>
|1| Days. What? No, yes, sorry, what? Oh, you're okay. Oh, thankGod. I had a terrible nightmare about you two. That was scary. Don'task. You don't want to know. You're safe now.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, okay.<|endoftext|>
|1| That's what counts. Blimey. Never dropped off like that before.Well, never, really. I'm getting on a bit, you see. Don't let the coolgear fool you. Now, what's wrong with the console? Red flashing lights.I bet they mean something.<|endoftext|>
|0| Er, Doctor, I also had a kind of dream thing.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, so did I.<|endoftext|>
|0| Not a nightmare, though, just, er, we were married.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah. In a little village.<|endoftext|>
|0| A sweet little village, and you were pregnant.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, I was huge. I was a boat.<|endoftext|>
|0| So you had the same dream, then? Exactly the same dream?<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you calling me a boat?<|endoftext|>
|0| And Doctor, you were visiting.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, yeah, you came to our cottage.<|endoftext|>
|0| How can we have the same dream? It doesn't make any sense.<|endoftext|>
|0| And you had a nightmare about us. What happened to us in thenightmare?<|endoftext|>
|1| It was a bit similar, in some aspects.<|endoftext|>
|0| Which aspects?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, all of them.<|endoftext|>
|0| You had the same dream.<|endoftext|>
|1| Basically.<|endoftext|>
|0| You said it was a nightmare.<|endoftext|>
|1| Did I say nightmare? No, more of a really good mare. Look, itdoesn't matter. We all had some kind of psychic episode. We probablyjumped a time track or something. Forget it. We're back to reality now.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor? If we're back to reality, how come I can still hear birds?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, the same birds. The same ones we heard in the<|endoftext|>
|0| Dream. Oh! Sorry. Nodded off. Stupid. God, Imust be overdoing it. I was dreaming we were back on the Tardis.<|endoftext|>
|0| You had the same dream, didn't you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Weren't we just saying the same thing?<|endoftext|>
|0| But we thought this was the dream, didn't we?<|endoftext|>
|0| I think so. Why do dreams have to fade so quickly?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, what is going on?<|endoftext|>
|0| Is this because of you? Is this some Time Lordy thing becauseyou've shown up again?<|endoftext|>
|1| Listen to me. Trust nothing. From now on, trust nothing yousee, hear or feel.<|endoftext|>
|0| But we're awake now.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah. You thought you were awake on the Tardis, too.<|endoftext|>
|0| But we're home.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, you're home. You're also dreaming. Trouble is, Rory, Amy,which is which? Are we flashing forwards or backwards? Hold on tight.This is going be a tricky one.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, this is bad. I don't like this.<|endoftext|>
|1| Argh. Never use force. You just embarrass yourself. Unlessyou're cross, in which case, always use force.<|endoftext|>
|0| Shall I run and get the manual?<|endoftext|>
|1| I threw it in a supernova.<|endoftext|>
|0| You threw the manual in a supernova? Why?<|endoftext|>
|1| Because I disagreed with it. Stop talking to me when I'm cross.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, but whatever's wrong with the Tardis, is that what causedus to dream about the future?<|endoftext|>
|1| If we were dreaming of the future.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, of course we were. We were in Leadworth.<|endoftext|>
|0| Upper Leadworth.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, and we could still be in Upper Leadworth, dreaming ofthis. Don't you get it?<|endoftext|>
|0| No, okay? No, this is real. I'm definitely awake now.<|endoftext|>
|1| And you thought you were definitely awake when you were allelephanty.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hey. Pregnant.<|endoftext|>
|1| And you could be giving birth right now. This could be thedream. I told you. Trust nothing we see or hear or feel. Look aroundyou. Examine everything. Look for all the details that don't ring true.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, we're in a spaceship that's bigger on the inside than theoutside.<|endoftext|>
|0| With a bow tie-wearing alien.<|endoftext|>
|0| So maybe what rings true isn't so simple.<|endoftext|>
|1| Valid point.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's dead. We're in a dead time machine.<|endoftext|>
|1| Remember, this is real. But when we wake up in the other place,remember how real this feels.<|endoftext|>
|0| It is real. I know it's real.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, this is the real one. Definitely this one. It's all solid.<|endoftext|>
|1| It felt solid in the Tardis too. You can't spot a dream whileyou're having it.<|endoftext|>
|0| What are you doing?<|endoftext|>
|1| Looking for motion blur, pixilation. It could be a computersimulation. I don't think so, though.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello, Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hi.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hello. You're a doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah. And unlike you, I've actually passed some exams.<|endoftext|>
|1| A doctor, not a nurse. Just like you've always dreamed. Howinteresting.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is?<|endoftext|>
|1| Your dream wife, your dream job, probably your dream baby.Maybe this is your dream.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's Amy's dream too. Isn't it, Amy?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes. Course it is, yeah.<|endoftext|>
|1| What's that?<|endoftext|>
|0| Old people's home.<|endoftext|>
|1| You said everyone here lives to their nineties. There'ssomething here that doesn't make sense. Let's go and poke it with astick.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh. Can we not do the running thing?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh hello, Doctor Williams.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello, Rory love.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello, Mrs Poggit. How's your hip?<|endoftext|>
|0| A bit stiff.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, easy, D-96 compound, plus. No, you don't have that yet.Forget that.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who's your friend? A junior doctor?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Can I borrow you? You're the size of my grandson.<|endoftext|>
|1| Slightly keen to move on. Freak psychic schism to sort out.You're incredibly old, aren't you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, I hate this, Doctor. Stop it, becausethis is definitely real. It's definitely this one. I keep saying that,don't I?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's bloody cold.<|endoftext|>
|1| The heating's off.<|endoftext|>
|0| The heating's off?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah. Put on a jumper. That's what I always do.<|endoftext|>
|0| Er, yes. Sorry about Mrs Poggit. She's so lovely though.<|endoftext|>
|1| I wouldn't believe her nice old lady act if I were you.<|endoftext|>
|0| What do you mean, act?<|endoftext|>
|1| Everything's off. Sensors, core power. We're drifting. Thescanner's down so we can't even see out. We could be anywhere. Someone,something, is overriding my controls.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, that took a while. Honestly, I'd heard such goodthings. Last of the Time Lords, the Oncoming Storm. Him in the bow tie.<|endoftext|>
|1| How did you get into my Tardis? What are you?<|endoftext|>
|0| What shall we call me? Well, if you're the Time Lord, let'scall me the Dream Lord.<|endoftext|>
|1| Nice look.<|endoftext|>
|0| This? No, I'm not convinced. Bow ties?<|endoftext|>
|0| Interesting. I'd love to be impressed, but Dream Lord. It'sin the name, isn't it? Spooky. Not quite there.<|endoftext|>
|0| And yet, very much here.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'll do the talking, thank you. Amy, want to take a guess atwhat that is?<|endoftext|>
|0| Er, Dream Lord. He creates dreams.<|endoftext|>
|1| Dreams, delusions, cheap tricks.<|endoftext|>
|0| And what about the gooseberry, here. Does he get a guess?<|endoftext|>
|0| Er, listen, mate. If anyone's the gooseberry round here, it's theDoctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well now, there's a delusion I'm not responsible for.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, he is. Isn't he, Amy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, Amy, have to sort your men out. Choose, even.<|endoftext|>
|0| I have chosen. Of course I've chosen.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's you, stupid.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, good. Thanks.<|endoftext|>
|0| You can't fool me. I've seen your dreams. Some of themtwice. Amy. Blimey, I'd blush if I had a blood supply or a real face.<|endoftext|>
|1| Where did you pick up this cheap cabaret act?<|endoftext|>
|0| Me? Oh, you're on shaky ground.<|endoftext|>
|1| Am I?<|endoftext|>
|0| If you had any more tawdry quirks you could open up aTawdry Quirk Shop. The madcap vehicle, the cockamamie hair, the clothesdesigned by a first-year fashion student. I'm surprised you haven't gota little purple space dog just to ram home what an intergalactic wagyou are. Where was I?<|endoftext|>
|0| You were<|endoftext|>
|0| I know where I was. So, here's your challenge. Two worlds.Here, in the time machine, and there, in the village that time forgot.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh. Or are you waking up?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, this is bad. This is very, very bad. Look at thisX-ray. Your brain is completely see-through. But then, I've always beenable to see through you, Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Always? What do you mean, always?<|endoftext|>
|0| Now then, the prognosis is this. If you die in the dream,you wake up in reality. Healthy recovery in next to no time. Ask mewhat happens if you die in reality?<|endoftext|>
|0| What happens?<|endoftext|>
|0| You die, stupid. That's why it's called reality.<|endoftext|>
|0| Have you met the Doctor before? Do you know him? Doctor, does he?<|endoftext|>
|0| Now don't get jealous. He's been around, our boy. But nevermind that. You've got a world to choose. One reality was always toomuch for you, Doctor. Take two and call me in the morning.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, I don't like him.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who is he?<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't know. It's a big universe.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why is he doing this?<|endoftext|>
|1| Maybe because he has no physical form. That gets you down aftera while, so he's taking it out on folk like us who can touch and eatand feel.<|endoftext|>
|0| What does he mean, deadly danger, though? Nothing deadly hashappened here. I mean, a bit of natural wastage, obviously.<|endoftext|>
|1| They've all gone. They've all gone.<|endoftext|>
|0| Stop. You two, over there. Come along, where's the rest of you?Come on, come on. We're going up to the castle now. All of you, comeon.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why would they leave?<|endoftext|>
|0| And what did you mean about Mrs Poggit's nice old lady act?<|endoftext|>
|1| One of my tawdry quirks. Sniffing out things that aren't whatthey seem. So, come on, let's think. The mechanics of this realitysplit we're stuck in. Time asleep exactly matches time in our dreamworld, unlike in conventional dreams.<|endoftext|>
|0| And we're all dreaming the same dream at the same time.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, sort of communal trance. Very rare, very complicated. I'msure there's a dream giveaway, a tell, but my mind isn't workingbecause this village is so dull! I'm slowing down, like you two have.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ooo. Ow. Really. Ow! It's coming. <|endoftext|>
|1| Okay, you're a doctor, help her.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're a doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's okay, we're doctors.<|endoftext|>
|0| What do we do?<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, it's not coming.<|endoftext|>
|1| What?<|endoftext|>
|0| This is my life now and it just turned you white as a sheet, sodon't you call it dull again, ever. Okay?<|endoftext|>
|1| Sorry.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah.<|endoftext|>
|1| Now, we all know there's an elephant in the room.<|endoftext|>
|0| I have to be this size, I'm having a baby.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, no. The hormones seem real, but no. Is nobody going tomention Rory's ponytail? You hold him down, I'll cut it off?<|endoftext|>
|0| This from the man in the bow tie.<|endoftext|>
|1| Bow ties are cool. I don't know about you, but I wouldn't hireMrs Poggit as a babysitter. What's she doing? What does she want?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, no. Here we go.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's really cold. Have you got any warmclothing?<|endoftext|>
|1| What does it matter if we're cold? We have to know what she isup to. Sorry, sorry. There should be some stuff down there. Have alook.<|endoftext|>
|0| I want the other life. You know, where we're happy and settledand about to have a baby.<|endoftext|>
|0| But don't you wonder, if that life is real, then why would we giveup all this? Why would anyone?<|endoftext|>
|0| Because we're going to freeze to death?<|endoftext|>
|0| The Doctor'll fix it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay. Because we're going to get married?<|endoftext|>
|0| We can still get married some day.<|endoftext|>
|0| You don't want to any more. I thought you'd chosen me, not him.<|endoftext|>
|0| You are always so insecure.<|endoftext|>
|0| You ran off with another man.<|endoftext|>
|0| Not in that way.<|endoftext|>
|0| It was the night before our wedding.<|endoftext|>
|0| We're in a time machine. It can be the night before our weddingfor as long as we want.<|endoftext|>
|0| We have to grow up eventually.<|endoftext|>
|0| Says who?<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah, Rory, wind. Amy, could you attach this to the monitor,please.<|endoftext|>
|0| I was promised amazing worlds. Instead I get duff central heatingand a weird, kitcheny wind-up device.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's a generator. Get winding.<|endoftext|>
|0| Not enough.<|endoftext|>
|1| Rory, wind.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why is the Dream Lord picking on you? Why us?<|endoftext|>
|0| Where are we?<|endoftext|>
|1| We're in trouble.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is that?<|endoftext|>
|1| A star. A cold star.<|endoftext|>
|1| That's why we're freezing. It's not a heating malfunction.We're drifting towards a cold sun. There's our deadly danger for thisversion of reality.<|endoftext|>
|0| So this must be the dream. There's no such thing as a cold star.Stars burn.<|endoftext|>
|1| So's this one. It's just burning cold.<|endoftext|>
|0| Is that possible?<|endoftext|>
|1| I can't know everything. Why does everybody expect me to,always?<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, this is something you haven't seen before. So does thatmean this is the dream?<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't know, but there it is, and I'd say we've got aboutfourteen minutes until we crash into it. But that's not a problem.<|endoftext|>
|0| Because you know how to get us out of this?<|endoftext|>
|1| Because we'll have frozen to death by then.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, then what are we going to do?<|endoftext|>
|1| Stay calm. Don't get sucked in to it, because this just mightbe the battle that we have to lose.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, this is so you, isn't it?<|endoftext|>
|1| What?<|endoftext|>
|0| Huh, what? A weird new star, fourteen minutes left to live andonly one man to save the day, huh? I just wanted a nice village and afamily.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh dear, Doctor. Dissent in the ranks. There was an olddoctor from Gallifrey, who ended up throwing his life away. He let downhis friends and<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, no. We've run out of time. Don't spend too long there,or you'll catch your death here.<|endoftext|>
|1| Where have the children gone?<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't know. Play time's probably over.<|endoftext|>
|0| You see, this is the real one. I just feel it. Don't you feel it?<|endoftext|>
|0| I feel it both places.<|endoftext|>
|0| I feel it here. It's just so tranquil and relaxed. Nothing badcould ever happen here.<|endoftext|>
|0| Not really me, though, is it? I mean, would I be happy settlingdown in a place with a pub, two shops and a really bad AmateurDramatics Society? That's why I got pregnant, so I don't have to seethem doing Oklahoma. Doctor, what are you doing? And what are thosepiles of dust?<|endoftext|>
|1| Play time's definitely over.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, my God.<|endoftext|>
|0| What happened to them?<|endoftext|>
|1| I think they did.<|endoftext|>
|0| They're just old people.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, they're very old people. Sorry, Rory, I don't think you'rewhat's been keeping them alive.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello, peasants. What's this, attack of the old people? Oh,that's ridiculous. This has got to be the dream, hasn't it? What do youthink, Amy? Let's all jump under a bus and wake up in the Tardis. Youfirst.<|endoftext|>
|1| Leave her alone.<|endoftext|>
|0| Do that again. I love it when he does that. Tall dark hero.Leave her alone.<|endoftext|>
|0| Just leave her.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, you're not quite so impressive, but I know where yourheart lies, don't I, Amy Pond?<|endoftext|>
|0| Shut up. Just shut up and leave me alone.<|endoftext|>
|0| But listen. You're in there. Loves a redhead, the Doctor.Has he told you about Elizabeth the First? Well, she thought she wasthe first.<|endoftext|>
|1| Drop it. Drop all of it. I know who you are.<|endoftext|>
|0| Course you don't.<|endoftext|>
|1| Course I do. No idea how you can be here, but there's only oneperson in the universe who hates me as much as you do.<|endoftext|>
|0| Never mind me. Maybe you should worry about them.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hi. Hello.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hello, we were wondering where you went. To get reinforcements,by the look of it. Are you all right? You look a bit tense.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello, Mister Nainby.<|endoftext|>
|1| Rory.<|endoftext|>
|0| Mister Nainby ran the sweet shop. He used to slip me the odd freetoffee.<|endoftext|>
|0| Did I not say thank you?<|endoftext|>
|0| How did he do that?<|endoftext|>
|1| I suspect he's not himself. Don't get comfortable here. You mayhave to run, fast.<|endoftext|>
|0| Can't we just talk to them?<|endoftext|>
|0| There is an eye in her mouth.<|endoftext|>
|1| There's a whole creature inside her. Inside all of them.They've been there for years, living and waiting.<|endoftext|>
|0| That is disgusting. They're not going to be peeping out ofanywhere else, are they?<|endoftext|>
|1| Run. Okay, leave them, leave them. Talk to me. Talk to me. Youare Eknodines. A proud, ancient race. you're better than this.<|endoftext|>
|1| Why are you hiding away here? Why aren't you at home?<|endoftext|>
|0| We were driven from our planet by<|endoftext|>
|1| Planet by upstart neighbours.<|endoftext|>
|0| So we've<|endoftext|>
|1| Been living here inside the bodies of old humans for years. Nowonder they live so long. You're keeping them alive.<|endoftext|>
|0| We were humbled and destroyed. Now we will do the same toothers.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay. Makes sense, I suppose. Credible enough. Could be real.<|endoftext|>
|0| Morning.<|endoftext|>
|1| You need to leave this planet.<|endoftext|>
|0| Wait. Stop.<|endoftext|>
|0| After all I've done for the over seventies in this village.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, this is crazy. She loves me. I fixed her depression. She'sjust a little old lady.<|endoftext|>
|0| Mrs Hamill, we don't understand.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'll deal with this one, Chubs. Now<|endoftext|>
|0| I can't hit her.<|endoftext|>
|0| Tut. Whack her!<|endoftext|>
|0| We just ran away. We just abandoned theDoctor. Don't ever call me Chubs again. We don't see him for years, andsomehow we don't really connect any more, and then, then he takes thebullet for us.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hey, he'll be fine. You know the Doctor. He's Mister Cool.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, I love a good butcher's, don't you? We've got to usethese places or they'll shut down. Oh, but you're probably avegetarian, aren't you, you big flop-haired wuss.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, pipe down. I'm busy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Maybe you need a little sleep.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, wait a moment. If you fall asleep here, several dozenangry pensioners will destroy you with their horrible eye things.<|endoftext|>
|0| Fingers in the ear. Brilliant. What's next, shouting boo?Come in, come in.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, we've got lots at steak here this week. Lots at steak,get it? Are these jokes wasted on you?<|endoftext|>
|1| Wait, wait, stop.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh. Oh, I can't watch.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ah, it's colder.<|endoftext|>
|1| The three of us have to agree, now, which is the dream.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's this, here.<|endoftext|>
|0| He could be right. The science is all wrong here. Burning ice?<|endoftext|>
|1| No, no, no. Ice can burn. Sofas can read. It's a big universe.We have to agree which battle to lose. All of us, now.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, which world do you think is real?<|endoftext|>
|1| This one.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, the other one.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, but are we disagreeing or competing?<|endoftext|>
|0| Competing? Over what? Oh.<|endoftext|>
|1| Nine minutes till impact.<|endoftext|>
|0| What temperature is it?<|endoftext|>
|1| Outside? Brrr. How many noughts have you got? Inside? I don'tknow but I can't feel my feet and other parts.<|endoftext|>
|0| I think all my parts are basically fine.<|endoftext|>
|1| Stop competing.<|endoftext|>
|0| Can't we call for help?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, because the universe is really small and there's bound tobe someone nearby.<|endoftext|>
|0| Put these on, both of you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, a poncho. The biggest crime against fashion since lederhosen.<|endoftext|>
|0| Here we go. My boys. My poncho boys. If we're going to die, let'sdie looking like a Peruvian folk band.<|endoftext|>
|0| We're not going to die.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, we're not, but our time's running out. If we fall asleephere we're in trouble. If we could divide up, then we'd have an activepresence in each world, but the Dream Lord is switching us between theworlds. Why? Why? what's the logic?<|endoftext|>
|0| Good idea, veggie. Let's divide you three up, so I can havea little chat with our lovely companion. Maybe I'll keep her, and youcan have Pointy Nose to yourself for all eternity, should you manage toclamber aboard some sort of reality.<|endoftext|>
|0| Can you hear that?<|endoftext|>
|0| What? No.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy, don't be scared. We'll be back.<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory, Doctor, don't leave me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy, we're going to have fun, aren't we?<|endoftext|>
|0| No, please, not alone.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay, where is it?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh help, somebody.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, you couldn't live near the shops, could you. <|endoftext|>
|0| Help me!<|endoftext|>
|1| It's okay, it's only me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Get in, get in, get in. Quickly, quickly, over here. Quickly. Getin.<|endoftext|>
|1| Come on, jump in. Quickly, get in now. Quickly. Hurry up. Arewe in?<|endoftext|>
|1| Come on, let's go.<|endoftext|>
|0| Quickly, in here.<|endoftext|>
|1| All four, quick.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's it. Clear.<|endoftext|>
|1| Everyone in.<|endoftext|>
|0| Poor Amy. He always leaves you, doesn't he, alone in thedark. Never apologises.<|endoftext|>
|0| He doesn't have to.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's good, because he never will. And now he's left youwith me. Spooky old, not to be trusted me. Anything could happen.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who are you, and what do you want? The Doctor knows you, but he'snot telling me who you are. And he always does. Takes him a whilesometimes, but he tells me. So you're something different.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, is that who you think you are? The one he trusts?<|endoftext|>
|0| Actually, yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| The only girl in the universe to whom the Doctor tellseverything?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| So what's his name? Now, which one of these men would youreally choose? Look at them. You ran away with a handsome hero. Wouldyou really give him up for a bumbling country doctor who thinks theonly thing he needs to be interesting is a ponytail?<|endoftext|>
|0| Stop it.<|endoftext|>
|0| But maybe it's better than loving and losing the Doctor.Pick a world, and this nightmare will all be over. They'll listen toyou. It's you they're waiting for. Amy's men. Amy's choice.<|endoftext|>
|1| Everybody, out, out, out. Into the church, that's right. Don'tanswer the door.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's make your mind up time in both worlds.<|endoftext|>
|1| Fine. I need to find my friends.<|endoftext|>
|0| Friends? Is that the right word for the people you acquire?Friends are people you stay in touch with. Your friends never see youagain once they've grown up. The old man prefers the company of theyoung, does he not?<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay.<|endoftext|>
|0| How did I get up here?<|endoftext|>
|0| I carried you. I'm afraid you may experience some bruising.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where's the Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't know. I want to do something for you.<|endoftext|>
|0| I was starting to like it.<|endoftext|>
|1| Sorry. I had to stop off at the butcher's.<|endoftext|>
|0| What are we going to do?<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't know. I thought the freezing Tardis was real but nowI'm not so sure.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh! I think the baby's starting.<|endoftext|>
|0| Honestly?<|endoftext|>
|0| Would I make it up at a time like this?<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, you do have a history of (gets a Look) being very lovely.Why are they so desperate to kill us?<|endoftext|>
|1| They're scared. Fear generates savagery.<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory!<|endoftext|>
|0| No, I'm not ready.<|endoftext|>
|0| Stay.<|endoftext|>
|0| Look after our baby.<|endoftext|>
|0| No. No. Come back. Save him. You save everyone. You always do.It's what you do.<|endoftext|>
|1| Not always. I'm sorry.<|endoftext|>
|0| Then what is the point of you?(Amy touches the pile of dust then gets up.)<|endoftext|>
|0| This is the dream. Definitely this one. Now, if we die here, wewake up, yeah?<|endoftext|>
|1| Unless we just die.<|endoftext|>
|0| Either way, this is my only chance of seeing him again. This isthe dream.<|endoftext|>
|1| How do you know?<|endoftext|>
|0| Because if this is real life, I don't want it. I don't want it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why aren't they attacking?<|endoftext|>
|1| Either because this is just a dream or because they know whatwe're about to do.<|endoftext|>
|1| Be very sure. This could be the real world.<|endoftext|>
|0| It can't be. Rory isn't here. I didn't know. I didn't, I didn't, Ihonestly didn't, till right now. I just want him.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay. Okay.<|endoftext|>
|0| I love Rory, and I never told him. But nowhe's gone.<|endoftext|>
|0| So, you chose this world. Well done. You got it right. Andwith only seconds left. Fair's fair. Let's warm you up.<|endoftext|>
|0| I hope you've enjoyed your little fictions. It all came outof your imagination, so I'll leave you to ponder on that. I have beendefeated. I shall withdraw. Farewell.<|endoftext|>
|0| Something happened. I. What happened to me? I.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh. Oh, right. This is good. I am liking this. Was it something Isaid? Could you tell what it was so I can use it in emergencies, andmaybe birthdays.<|endoftext|>
|0| What are we doing now?<|endoftext|>
|1| Me, I'm going to blow up the Tardis.<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|1| Notice how helpful the Dream Lord was? Okay, there wasmisinformation, red herrings, malice, and I could have done without thelimerick. But he was always very keen to make us choose between dreamand reality.<|endoftext|>
|0| What are you doing?.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, the Dream Lord conceded. This isn't a dream.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, it is.<|endoftext|>
|0| Stop him.<|endoftext|>
|1| Star burning cold? Do me a favour. The Dream Lord has no powerover the real world. He was offering us a choice between two dreams.<|endoftext|>
|0| How do you know that?<|endoftext|>
|1| Because I know who he is.<|endoftext|>
|1| Any questions?<|endoftext|>
|0| Er, what's that?<|endoftext|>
|1| A speck of psychic pollen from the candle meadows of Karass donSlava. Must have been hanging around for ages. Fell in the time rotor,heated up and induced a dream state for all of us.<|endoftext|>
|0| So that was the Dream Lord then? Those little specks.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, no. No. Sorry, wasn't it obvious? The Dream Lord was me.Psychic pollen. It's a mind parasite. It feeds on everything dark inyou, gives it a voice, turns it against you. I'm nine hundred andseven. It had a lot to go on.<|endoftext|>
|0| But why didn't it feed on us, too?<|endoftext|>
|1| The darkness in you pair, it would've starved to death in aninstant. I choose my friends with great care. Otherwise, I'm stuck withmy own company, and you know how that works out.<|endoftext|>
|0| But those things he said about you. You don't think any of that'strue?<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy, right now a question is about to occur to Rory. And seeingas the answer is about to change his life, I think you should give himyour full attention.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah. Actually, yeah.<|endoftext|>
|1| There it is.<|endoftext|>
|0| Because what I don't get is, you blew up the Tardis, that stoppedthat dream, but what stopped the Leadworth dream?<|endoftext|>
|0| We crashed the camper van.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, right. I don't remember that bit.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, you weren't there. You were already<|endoftext|>
|0| Already what?<|endoftext|>
|0| Dead. You died in that dream. Mrs Poggit got you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay. But how did you know it was a dream? Before you crashed thevan, how did you know you wouldn't just die?<|endoftext|>
|0| I didn't.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, oh.<|endoftext|>
|1| So, well then, where now? Or should I just pop down to theswimming pool for a few lengths?<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't know. Anywhere's good for me. I'm happy anywhere. It's upto Amy this time. Amy's choice. <|endoftext|>
|0| But who is this creature with terrible claws, terrible teeth in histerrible jaws? Go on, your bit. He, he has. Go on.<|endoftext|>
|0| I can't do it, Dad. I can listen to books, anyway.<|endoftext|>
|0| I know it doesn't come easy, son, but you've got to keep at it. Allright? You're not on your own with this.<|endoftext|>
|0| Mo, you'll be late for your shift.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, you're right. Sorry, El, got to go. Now, who loves you morethan me?<|endoftext|>
|0| No one.<|endoftext|>
|0| Stop saying that.<|endoftext|>
|0| Approaching stage four target drillingdepth. Stage four target drill depth scheduled in five, four, three,two, one. Stage four target drill depth achieved. Drill depth nowtwenty one kilometres.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hi. Nasreen here. Just to let you know we have just hit ournew target.<|endoftext|>
|0| Twenty one kilometres, folks. Further than anyone's ever drilledinto the Earth. Thanks for your amazing work. Have a great weekend.Onwards and downwards.<|endoftext|>
|0| How much further do you think we can we go, Mack?<|endoftext|>
|0| Into the unknown. Exciting, isn't it?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah.<|endoftext|>
|0| Evening, Mo.<|endoftext|>
|0| Twenty one k? Whoo hoo. You wanted to grab all the glory before Icome on shift. Right, off you go. Get out. My gaff for the night.<|endoftext|>
|0| Brilliant.<|endoftext|>
|0| That is mad.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, no. Please.<|endoftext|>
|1| Behold, Rio.<|endoftext|>
|0| Nah.<|endoftext|>
|0| Not really getting the sunshine carnival vibe.<|endoftext|>
|1| No? Ooo, feel that, though. What's that?<|endoftext|>
|1| Ground feels strange. Just me. Wait. That's weird.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's weird?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, stop trying to distract us. We're in the wrong place.Doctor, it's freezing and I've dressed for Rio. We are not stoppinghere. Doctor. You listening to me? It's a graveyard. You promised me abeach.<|endoftext|>
|1| Blue grass. Patches of it all around the graveyard. So, Earth,2020-ish, ten years in your future, wrong continent for Rio, I'lladmit, but it's not a massive overshoot.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why are those people waving at us?<|endoftext|>
|1| Can't be.<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't.<|endoftext|>
|1| It is. It's you two.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, we're here. How can we be up there?<|endoftext|>
|1| Ten years in your future. Come to relive past glories, I'dimagine. Humans, you're so nostalgic.<|endoftext|>
|0| We're still together in ten years?<|endoftext|>
|0| No need to sound so surprised.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hey, let's go and talk to them. We can say hi to future us. Howcool is that?<|endoftext|>
|1| Er, no, best not. Really best not. These things get complicatedvery quickly, and oh look. Big mining thing. Oh, I love a big miningthing. See, way better than Rio. Rio doesn't have a big mining thing.<|endoftext|>
|0| We're not going to have a look, are we?<|endoftext|>
|1| Let's go and have a look. Come on, you two, let's see whatthey're doing.<|endoftext|>
|0| If he can't get us to Rio, how's he ever going to get us backhome?<|endoftext|>
|0| Did you not see over there? It all works out fine.<|endoftext|>
|0| After everything we've seen, we just drop back into our oldlives? The nurse and the kissogram?<|endoftext|>
|0| I guess. He's getting away.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hang on. What are you doing with that?<|endoftext|>
|0| Engagement ring. I thought you liked me wearing it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy, you could lose it. Cost a lot of money, that.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hmm. Spoilsport.<|endoftext|>
|0| Go on. I'll catch you both up.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| The drill's shut down. There's no sign of Mo.Nobody's been in or out of the perimeter between last night and now.What's that? That wasn't there last night. How the hell did that getthere?<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't know.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, that was quick.<|endoftext|>
|0| Was it?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's great that you came.<|endoftext|>
|0| Bit retro. What is it, portable crime lab?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, er, sort of.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ambrose Northover. I was the one who called. I run the mealson wheels for the whole valley. This is my son, Elliot.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where's your uniform?<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't be cheeky, Elliot. He's plain clothes. CID, is it?Anyway, it's over here.<|endoftext|>
|0| Er, okay.<|endoftext|>
|1| Restricted access. No unauthorisedpersonnel. Hmm.<|endoftext|>
|0| That is breaking and entering.<|endoftext|>
|1| What did I break? Sonicking and entering. Totally different.<|endoftext|>
|0| Come on, then.<|endoftext|>
|1| You're sure Rory'll catch us up?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's a family plot, see. My aunt Gladys died six years ago.Her husband, Alun, died a few weeks back. He lived in the house twodoors down. There's not many of us left up here now.<|endoftext|>
|0| Mum, he doesn't care about that. He wants to know about thedead bodies.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes. Sorry. Well, they always wanted to be buried in the sameplot, together. But when we went to bury Uncle Alun, Gladys wasn'tthere. Gone. Body, coffin, everything.<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|0| The mad thing is, on the surface, the grave was untouched. Nosigns of it having been messed with.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm sorry, I don't understand.<|endoftext|>
|0| Nobody has touched the grave since my aunt was buried. Butwhen they dug it open, the body was gone. How is that possible?<|endoftext|>
|1| What about now? Can you feel it now?<|endoftext|>
|0| Honestly, I've got no idea what you're on about.<|endoftext|>
|1| The ground doesn't feel like it should.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's ten years in the future. Maybe how this ground feels is howit always feels.<|endoftext|>
|1| Good thought, but no, it doesn't. Hear that, drill in start-upmode. Afterwaves of a recent seismological shift and blue grass.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, please. Have you always been this disgusting?<|endoftext|>
|1| No, that's recent. What's in<|endoftext|>
|1| Here? Hello.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who are you? What're you doing here? And what're you wearing?<|endoftext|>
|0| I dressed for Rio.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ministry of Drills, Earth and Science. New Ministry, quite big,just merged. It's lot of responsibility on our shoulders. Don't like totalk about it. What are you doing?<|endoftext|>
|0| None of your business.<|endoftext|>
|1| Where are you getting these readings from?<|endoftext|>
|0| Under the soil.<|endoftext|>
|0| The drill's up and running again. What's going on? Who are thesepeople?<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy, the Doctor. We're not staying, are we, Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|1| Why's there a big patch of earth in the middle of your floor?<|endoftext|>
|0| We don't know. It just appeared overnight.<|endoftext|>
|1| Good. Right. You all need to get out of here very fast.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why?<|endoftext|>
|1| What's your name?<|endoftext|>
|0| Nasreen Chaudhry.<|endoftext|>
|1| Look at the screens, Nasreen. Look at your readings. It'smoving.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hey, that's specialised equipment. Get away from it.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, this steam, is that a good thing?<|endoftext|>
|1| Shouldn't think so. It's shifting when it shouldn't beshifting.<|endoftext|>
|0| What shouldn't?<|endoftext|>
|1| The ground, the soil, the earth, moving. But how? Why?<|endoftext|>
|0| Earthquake?<|endoftext|>
|0| What's going on?<|endoftext|>
|1| Doubt it, because it's only happening under this room.<|endoftext|>
|1| It knows we're here. It's attacking. The ground's attacking us.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, no that's not possible.<|endoftext|>
|1| Under the circumstances, I'd suggest, run!<|endoftext|>
|0| Tony!<|endoftext|>
|1| Stay back, Amy. Stay away from the earth.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's okay.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's pulling me down.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, help me. Something's got me.<|endoftext|>
|1| Stay away from it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, the ground's got my legs.<|endoftext|>
|1| I've got you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay.<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't let go.<|endoftext|>
|1| Never.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, what is it, and why is it doing this?<|endoftext|>
|1| Stay calm. Keep hold of my hand. Don't let go. Your drill, shutit down. Go. Now!<|endoftext|>
|0| Can you get me out?<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy, try and stay calm. If you struggle, it'll make thingsworse. Keep hold of my hand.<|endoftext|>
|0| Shut down all drilling activity as quickas you can.<|endoftext|>
|0| Reducing main unit power.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm not going to let you go.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, it's pulling me down. Something's pulling me.<|endoftext|>
|1| Stay calm. Now, hold on till they can just shut down the drill.<|endoftext|>
|0| I can't hold on!<|endoftext|>
|0| Tony, we've got to be faster.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm doing my best. Come on, shut down.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's pulling me? What is under the earth? Idon't want to suffocate under there.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy, concentrate. Don't you give up.<|endoftext|>
|0| Tell Rory<|endoftext|>
|1| No. Amy! Amy, no!<|endoftext|>
|1| No! No! No! No! No. No! No. No. No. No. (etc etc)<|endoftext|>
|0| Where is she?<|endoftext|>
|1| She's gone. The ground took her.<|endoftext|>
|0| Do you want sugar?<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry?<|endoftext|>
|0| In your tea. Mum's asking.<|endoftext|>
|0| No. Just white, thanks.<|endoftext|>
|0| There's only one explanation, as far as I can see.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's that, then?<|endoftext|>
|0| The graves eat people. Devour them whole, leaving no trace.<|endoftext|>
|0| Not sure about that.<|endoftext|>
|0| They didn't steal the body from above. They couldn't have gotin from the sides. Only other thing is, they get in from underneath.<|endoftext|>
|0| Not very likely, though.<|endoftext|>
|0| When you've eliminated the impossible, whatever remains,however improbable, must be the truth.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry?<|endoftext|>
|0| Sherlock Holmes. Got the audiobook. The graves round here eatpeople.<|endoftext|>
|0| Is that what happened to Mo? Are they dead?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's not quicksand. She didn't just sink. Something pulled herin. It wanted her.<|endoftext|>
|0| The ground wanted her?<|endoftext|>
|1| You said the ground was dormant. Just a patch of earth, whenyou first saw it this morning. And the drill had been stopped.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's right.<|endoftext|>
|1| But when you re-started the drill, the ground fought back.<|endoftext|>
|0| So what, the ground wants to stop us drilling? Doctor, that isridiculous.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm not saying that, and it's not ridiculous, I just don'tthink it's right. Oh, ofcourse. It's bio-programming.<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|1| Bio-programming. Oh, it's clever. You use bio-signals toresonate the internal molecular structure of natural objects. It'smainly used in engineering and construction, mostly jungle planets, butthat's way in the future and not here. What's it doing here?<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry, did you just say jungle planets?<|endoftext|>
|0| You're not making any sense, man.<|endoftext|>
|1| Excuse me, I'm making perfect sense. You're just not keepingup. The earth, the ground beneath our feet, was bio-programmed toattack.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, even if that were possible, which, by the way, it's not,why?<|endoftext|>
|1| Stop you drilling. Okay, so we find whatever's doing thebio-programming, we can find Amy. We can get her back. Shush, shush,shush. Have I gone mad? I've gone mad.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| Shush, shush. Silence. Absolute silence. You've stopped thedrill, right?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|1| And you've only got the one drill?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|1| You're sure about that?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|1| So, if you shut the drill down, why can I still hear drilling?It's under the ground.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's not possible.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hacking into your records. Probe reports, samples, sensors.Good. Just unite the data, make it all one big conversation. Let's havea look. So, we are here and this is your drill hole. Twenty one pointzero zero nine kilometres. Well done.<|endoftext|>
|0| Thank you. It's taken us a long time.<|endoftext|>
|1| Why here, though? Why'd you drill on this site?<|endoftext|>
|1| The blue grass? Oh, Nasreen. Those trace minerals weren't Xmarking the spot, saying dig here. They were a warning. Stay away.Because while you've been drilling down, somebody else has beendrilling up.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, beautiful. Network of tunnels all the way down.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, no, we've surveyed that area.<|endoftext|>
|1| You only saw what you went looking for.<|endoftext|>
|1| Heat signals. Wait, dual readings, hot and cold, doesn't makesense. And now they're moving. Fast. How many people live nearby?<|endoftext|>
|0| Just my daughter and her family. The rest of the staff travel in.<|endoftext|>
|1| Grab this equipment and follow me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why? What're we doing?<|endoftext|>
|1| That noise isn't a drill, it's transport. Three of them, thirtykilometres down. Rate of speed looks about a hundred and fiftykilometres an hour. Should be here in ooo, quite soon. Twelve minutes.Whatever bio-programmed the Earth is on its way up, now.<|endoftext|>
|0| How can something be coming up when there'sonly the Earth's crust down there?<|endoftext|>
|1| You saw the readings.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who are you, anyway? How can you know all this?<|endoftext|>
|0| Whoa, did you see that?<|endoftext|>
|1| No, no, no.<|endoftext|>
|1| Energy signal originating from under the Earth. We're trapped.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, something weird's going on here, the graves are eatingpeople.<|endoftext|>
|1| Not now, Rory. Energy barricade, invisible to the naked eye. Wecan't get out and no one from the outside world can get in.<|endoftext|>
|0| What? Okay, what about the Tardis?<|endoftext|>
|0| The what?<|endoftext|>
|1| Er, no. Those energy patterns would play havoc with thecircuits. With a bit of time, maybe, but we've only got nine and a halfminutes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Nine and a half minutes to what?<|endoftext|>
|0| We're trapped, and something's burrowing towards the surface.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where's Amy?<|endoftext|>
|1| Get everyone inside the church. Rory, I'll get her back.<|endoftext|>
|0| What do you mean, get her back? Where's she gone?<|endoftext|>
|1| She was taken. Into the Earth.<|endoftext|>
|0| How? Why didn't you stop it?<|endoftext|>
|1| I tried. I promise, I tried.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, you should've tried harder!<|endoftext|>
|1| I'll find Amy. I'll keep you all safe, I promise. Come on,please. I need you alongside me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where's Mo? Is he with you?<|endoftext|>
|0| This flaming door. Always sticking. I thought you were having itfixed.<|endoftext|>
|0| Dad!<|endoftext|>
|0| Something's happened to him, hasn't it?<|endoftext|>
|0| So we can't get out, we can't contact anyone, and something,the something that took my husband, is coming up through the Earth.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes. If we move quickly enough, we can be ready.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, stop. This has gone far enough. What is this?<|endoftext|>
|0| He's telling the truth, love.<|endoftext|>
|0| Come on. It's not the first time we've had no mobile or phonesignals. Reception's always rubbish.<|endoftext|>
|0| Look, Ambrose. We saw the Doctor's friend get taken, okay? Yousaw the lightning in the sky. I have seen the impossible today, and theonly person who's made any sense of it for me, is the Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Him?<|endoftext|>
|1| Me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Can you get my dad back?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes. But I need you to trust me and do exactly as I say fromthis second onwards, because we're running out of time.<|endoftext|>
|0| So tell us what to do.<|endoftext|>
|1| Thank you. We have eight minutes to set up a line of defence.Bring me every phone, every camera, every piece of recording ortransmitting equipment you can find.<|endoftext|>
|1| Every burglar alarm, every movement sensor,every security light. I want the whole area covered with sensors.<|endoftext|>
|1| Right, guys, we need to be ready for whatever's coming up. Ineed a map of the village marking where the cameras are going.<|endoftext|>
|0| I can't do the words. I'm dyslexic.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, that's all right, I can't make a decent meringue. Draw likeyour life depends on it, Elliot.<|endoftext|>
|0| Six minutes forty.<|endoftext|>
|0| Works in quadrants. Every movement sensor and trip light we'vegot. If anything moves, we'll know.<|endoftext|>
|1| Good lad.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oi! What're you doing?<|endoftext|>
|1| Resources. Every little helps. Meals on wheels. What've you gothere, then. Warmer in the front, refrigerated in the back.<|endoftext|>
|0| Bit chilly for a hideout, mind.<|endoftext|>
|1| What are those?<|endoftext|>
|0| Like you say, every little helps.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, no weapons. It's not the way I do things.<|endoftext|>
|0| You said we're supposed to be defending ourselves.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, Ambrose, you're better than this. I'm asking nicely. Putthem away.<|endoftext|>
|1| Look at that. Perfect. Dyslexia never stopped Da Vinci orEinstein. It's not stopping you.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't understand what you're going to do.<|endoftext|>
|1| Two phase plan. First, the sensors and cameras will tell uswhen something arrives. Second, if something does arrive, I use this tosend a sonic pulse through that network of devices. A pulse which wouldtemporarily incapacitate most things in the universe.<|endoftext|>
|0| Knock 'em out. Cool.<|endoftext|>
|1| Lovely place to grow up round here.<|endoftext|>
|0| Suppose. I want to live in a city one day. Soon as I'm oldenough, I'll be off.<|endoftext|>
|1| I was the same where I grew up.<|endoftext|>
|0| Did you get away?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah.<|endoftext|>
|0| Do you ever miss it?<|endoftext|>
|1| So much.<|endoftext|>
|0| Is it monsters coming? Have you met monsters before?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah.<|endoftext|>
|0| You scared of them?<|endoftext|>
|1| No, they're scared of me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Will you really get my dad back?<|endoftext|>
|1| No question.<|endoftext|>
|0| I left my headphones at home.<|endoftext|>
|1| How're you doing?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's getting darker. How can it be getting dark so quickly?<|endoftext|>
|1| Shutting out light from within the barricade. Trying to isolateus in the dark. Which means<|endoftext|>
|1| It's here.<|endoftext|>
|0| They're close to the surface now.<|endoftext|>
|0| Tony.<|endoftext|>
|0| Like you didn't know.<|endoftext|>
|0| I can't open it. It keeps sticking. Thewood's warped.<|endoftext|>
|1| Any time you want to help.<|endoftext|>
|0| Can't you sonic it?<|endoftext|>
|1| It doesn't do wood.<|endoftext|>
|0| That is rubbish.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oi, don't diss the sonic.<|endoftext|>
|1| See if we can get a fix.<|endoftext|>
|0| No power.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's deliberate.<|endoftext|>
|0| What do we do now?<|endoftext|>
|1| Nothing. We've got nothing. They sent an energy surge to wreckour systems.<|endoftext|>
|0| Is everyone okay? Is anyone hurt?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm fine.<|endoftext|>
|0| Me too.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, what was that?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's like the holes at the drill station.<|endoftext|>
|0| Is this how they happened?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's coming through the final layer of Earth.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is?<|endoftext|>
|0| The banging's stopped.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where's Elliot? Has anyone seen Elliot? Did he come in? Was hein when the door was shut? Who counted him back in? Who saw him last?<|endoftext|>
|1| I did.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where is he?<|endoftext|>
|1| He said he was going to get headphones.<|endoftext|>
|0| And you let him go? He was out there on his own?<|endoftext|>
|0| Mum! Grandpa Tony! Let me in!<|endoftext|>
|0| Elliot!<|endoftext|>
|0| Let me in.<|endoftext|>
|0| He's out there. Help me!<|endoftext|>
|0| Open the door. Mum! There's something outhere.<|endoftext|>
|0| Push, Elliot.<|endoftext|>
|0| Push, Elliot. Give it a shove.<|endoftext|>
|0| Mum. Hurry up.<|endoftext|>
|0| Mum.<|endoftext|>
|0| Come on.<|endoftext|>
|0| Elliot! Where is he? He was here. He washere. Elliot!<|endoftext|>
|1| Ambrose, don't go running off!<|endoftext|>
|0| Ambrose!<|endoftext|>
|0| Elliot, it's Mum.<|endoftext|>
|0| Nooo!<|endoftext|>
|0| Get off me!<|endoftext|>
|0| Dad!<|endoftext|>
|1| What happened?<|endoftext|>
|0| My dad's hurt.<|endoftext|>
|1| Get him into the church now.<|endoftext|>
|0| Elliot's gone. They've killed him, haven't they?<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't think so. They've taken three people when they could'vejust killed them up here. There's still hope, Ambrose. There is alwayshope.<|endoftext|>
|0| Then why have they taken him?<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't know. I'll find Elliot, I promise. But first I've gotto stop this attack. Please, get inside the church.<|endoftext|>
|0| Come on, Dad.<|endoftext|>
|0| So what now?<|endoftext|>
|1| Cold blood. I know who they are.<|endoftext|>
|0| We got it.<|endoftext|>
|1| Defending the planet with meals on wheels.<|endoftext|>
|0| What was that?<|endoftext|>
|1| Sounds like they're leaving.<|endoftext|>
|0| Without this one?<|endoftext|>
|0| Looks like we scared them off.<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't think so. Now both sides have hostages.<|endoftext|>
|0| Let me out. Can anybody hear me? I'm alive in here! Let me out! Iknow you're out there. My name is Amy Pond and you'd better get me thehell out of here or so help me I am going to kick your backside.Please?<|endoftext|>
|0| Shush.<|endoftext|>
|0| Did you just shush me? Did you just shush me?<|endoftext|>
|0| No, no, no. No, don't do that. No gas. No gas!<|endoftext|>
|1| So, I think I've met these creaturesbefore. Different branch of the species, mind, but all the same. Let'ssee if our friend's thawed out.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you sure? By yourself?<|endoftext|>
|1| Very sure.<|endoftext|>
|0| But the sting?<|endoftext|>
|1| Venom gland takes at least twenty four hours to recharge. Am Iright? I know what I'm doing. I'll be fine.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm the Doctor. I've come to talk. I'm going to remove yourmask.<|endoftext|>
|1| You are beautiful. Remnant of a bygone age on planet Earth. Andby the way, lovely mode of travel. Geothermal currents projecting youup through a network of tunnels. Gorgeous. Mind if I sit? Now. Yourpeople have a friend of mine. I want her back. Why did you come to thesurface? What do you want? Oh, I do hate a monologue. Give us a bitback. How many are you?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm the last of my species.<|endoftext|>
|1| Really. No. Last of the species. The Klempari Defence. As aninterrogation defence, it's a bit old hat, I'm afraid.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm the last of my species.<|endoftext|>
|1| No. You're really not. Because I'm the last of my species and Iknow how it sits in a heart. So don't insult me. Let's start again.Tell me your name.<|endoftext|>
|0| Alaya.<|endoftext|>
|1| How long has your tribe been sleeping under the Earth, Alaya?It's not difficult to work out. You're three hundred million years outof your comfort zone. Question is, what woke you now?<|endoftext|>
|0| We were attacked.<|endoftext|>
|1| The drill.<|endoftext|>
|0| Our sensors detected a threat to our life support systems. Thewarrior class was activated to prevent the assault. We will wipe thevermin from the surface and reclaim our planet.<|endoftext|>
|1| Do we have to say vermin? They're really very nice.<|endoftext|>
|0| Primitive apes.<|endoftext|>
|1| Extraordinary species. You attack them, they'll fight back.But, there's a peace to be brokered here. I can help you with that.<|endoftext|>
|0| This land is ours. We lived here long before the apes.<|endoftext|>
|1| Doesn't give you automatic rights to it now, I'm afraid. Humanswon't give up the planet.<|endoftext|>
|0| So we destroy them.<|endoftext|>
|1| You underestimate them.<|endoftext|>
|0| You underestimate us.<|endoftext|>
|1| One tribe of homo reptilia against six billion humans? You'vegot your work cut out.<|endoftext|>
|0| We did not initiate combat, but we can still win.<|endoftext|>
|1| Tell me where my friend is. Give us back the people who weretaken.<|endoftext|>
|0| No.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm not going let you provoke a war, Alaya. There'll be nobattle here today.<|endoftext|>
|0| The fire of war is already lit. A massacre is due.<|endoftext|>
|1| Not while I'm here.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'll gladly die for my cause. What will you sacrifice for yours?<|endoftext|>
|0| You're going to what?<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm going to go down below the surface, to find the rest of thetribe, to talk to them.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're going to negotiate with these aliens?<|endoftext|>
|1| They're not aliens. They're Earth-liens. Once known as theSilurian race, or, some would argue, Eocenes, or HomoReptilia. Not monsters, not evil. Well, only as evil as you are. Theprevious owners of the planet, that's all. Look, from their point ofview, you're the invaders. Your drill was threatening their settlement.Now, the creature in the crypt. Her name's Alaya. She's one of theirwarriors, and she's my best bargaining chip. I need her alive. If shelives, so do Elliot and Mo and Amy, because I will find them. While I'mgone, you four people, in this church, in this corner of planet Earth,you have to be the best of humanity.<|endoftext|>
|0| And what if they come back? Shouldn't we be examining thiscreature? Dissecting it, finding its weak points?<|endoftext|>
|1| No dissecting, no examining. We return their hostage, theyreturn ours, nobody gets harmed. We can land this together, if you arethe best you can be. You are decent, brilliant people. Nobody diestoday. Understand?<|endoftext|>
|1| No, sorry, no. What are you doing?<|endoftext|>
|0| Coming with you, of course. What is it, some kind of transportpod?<|endoftext|>
|1| Sort of, but you're not coming with me.<|endoftext|>
|0| He's right. You're not.<|endoftext|>
|0| I have spent all my life excavating the layers of this planet,and now you want me to stand back while you head down into it? I don'tthink so.<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't have time to argue.<|endoftext|>
|0| I thought we were in a rush. <|endoftext|>
|1| It'll be dangerous.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, so's crossing the road.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, for goodness sake. All right, then. Come on.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hey. Come back safe.<|endoftext|>
|0| Of course.<|endoftext|>
|1| Welcome aboard the Tardis. Now, don't touchanything. Very precious.<|endoftext|>
|0| No way. But, but that's, this is fantastic. What does it do?<|endoftext|>
|1| Everything. I'm hoping, if we're going down, that barricadewon't interfere.<|endoftext|>
|1| Did you touch something?<|endoftext|>
|0| No. Isn't this what it does?<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm not doing anything. We've been hijacked. I can't stop it.They must've sensed the electro-magnetic field. They're pulling theTardis down into the Earth.<|endoftext|>
|0| You had to come and see me.<|endoftext|>
|0| We are going to keep you safe.<|endoftext|>
|0| Your tribe are going to give us back our people in exchangefor you.<|endoftext|>
|0| No. Shall I tell you what's really going to happen, apes? One ofyou will kill me. My death shall ignite a war, and every stinking apeshall be wiped from the surface of my beloved planet.<|endoftext|>
|0| We won't allow that to happen.<|endoftext|>
|0| I know apes better than you know yourselves. I know which one ofyou will kill me. Do you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Where are we?<|endoftext|>
|1| Looks like we fell through the bottom of their tunnel system.Don't suppose it was designed for handling something like this.<|endoftext|>
|0| How far down are we?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, a lot more than twenty one kilometres.<|endoftext|>
|0| So why aren't we burning alive?<|endoftext|>
|1| Don't know. Interesting, isn't it?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's like this is everyday to you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Not every day. Every other day.<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't struggle. Close your eyes and don't struggle.<|endoftext|>
|0| What? Where am I? Why can't I move my body?<|endoftext|>
|0| Decontamination, they call it. They did it to me while I wasconscious.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, you're freaking me out now. Did what? Who did?<|endoftext|>
|0| Dissected me.<|endoftext|>
|0| No.<|endoftext|>
|0| He's coming. I'm sorry. I wish I could help you.<|endoftext|>
|1| We're looking for a small tribal settlementprobably housing around a dozenHomo Reptilia? Maybe less.<|endoftext|>
|0| One small tribe.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah.<|endoftext|>
|1| Maybe more than a dozen. Maybe more like an entire civilisationliving beneath the Earth.<|endoftext|>
|1| This place is enormous and deserted. Themajority of the race are probably still asleep. We need to find Amy.Looking for heat signature anomalies.<|endoftext|>
|0| But Doctor, how can all this be here? I mean, these plants.<|endoftext|>
|1| Must be getting closer to the centre of the city.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're sure this is the best way to enter?<|endoftext|>
|1| Front door approach. Definitely. Always the best way.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hostile life forms detected area seventeen.<|endoftext|>
|1| Apart from the back door approach. That's also good. Sometimesbetter.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hostile life forms detected area seventeen.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hostile life forms detected area seventeen.<|endoftext|>
|1| We're not hostile. We're not armed. We're here in peace.<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't you come near me with that.<|endoftext|>
|0| From the clothing, the human female appears to be moreresistant to the cold than the male.<|endoftext|>
|0| I dressed for Rio!<|endoftext|>
|0| Leave her alone. You've got me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Argh.<|endoftext|>
|0| Decontamination complete. Commencing dissection.<|endoftext|>
|0| Area Seventeen incursion. Species diagnostic requested. AreaSeventeen incursion. Species diagnostic requested.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah. And stay out.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ah ah!<|endoftext|>
|0| You never picked a lizard man's pocket? Come on, before he getsback.<|endoftext|>
|0| That creature, do you think it was an alien?Any more of them, do you think? Do you think the Earth's been invaded?<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't know. But I know someone who could have some answers. Weneed to get back to the surface and find him. I wonder where thisleads.<|endoftext|>
|0| Maybe it's a way out of here.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, my God, no.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is it?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's my son. It's Elliot. What've they done to him? He's in there.We have to get him out. Elliot? Elliot, it's Dad.<|endoftext|>
|0| Access denied. Unauthorised genetic imprint.<|endoftext|>
|0| Stop. Seriously, we can't get in.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's my boy in there.<|endoftext|>
|0| These screens, they're monitoring something. I think they're vitalsigns. Heartbeats, pulses. Why else would he be wired up? He's stillalive.<|endoftext|>
|0| All right. We find weapons, get that creature from the lab andforce it to release Elliot, yeah?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah. Trust me. We'll get him out.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ambrose.<|endoftext|>
|0| You lied. You told us you were the police.<|endoftext|>
|0| It was a misunderstanding.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who are you? You and the Doctor? Why is this happening to us?What did we ever do?<|endoftext|>
|0| The Doctor'll get your son back, I promise. In the meantime, wetake turns guarding the creature.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, so that's it? We just sit and wait.<|endoftext|>
|0| And then we exchange her for your family. I promise you, Ambrose,I trust the Doctor with my life. We stick to his plan. We keep thatcreature safe.<|endoftext|>
|1| Argh.<|endoftext|>
|0| How can they have escaped? This proves all prisoners shouldremain under military guard.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm sure you'd prefer to be in charge of everything andeveryone, Restac, but we rank the same. Is there any word from Alaya?<|endoftext|>
|0| No.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's fine to show concern, you know. She's part of yourgene-chain. I'm decontaminating now.<|endoftext|>
|1| Decontamination? No, no, no.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why aren't you dead? You're carrying my venom in your blood. Butyou should have died. Why aren't you dead? Show me.<|endoftext|>
|0| How does it feel, ape?<|endoftext|>
|0| Like it's burning in my blood. Please, if you help me, I can helpyou. If you could cure me, I could help you escape.<|endoftext|>
|0| You see? You beg and offer betrayal so early. Why would I wantto escape when I can watch you die? The first ape death of the comingwar.<|endoftext|>
|1| No! Argh!<|endoftext|>
|0| It's all right, it won't harm you. I'm only neutralising allyour ape bacteria.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm not an ape. Look at the scans. Two hearts. Totallydifferent. Totally not ape! Remove all human germs, you remove half thethings keeping me alive.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, complete the process.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, that's much better, thanks. Not got any celery, have you?No. No, not really the climate. Tomatoes, though. You'd do a roaringtrade in those. I'm the Doctor. Oh, and there's Nasreen. Good.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, a green man.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hello. Who are you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Restac, Military commander.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh dear, really? There's always a military, isn't there?<|endoftext|>
|0| Your weapon was attacking the oxygen pockets above our city.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oxygen pockets, lovely. Ooo, but not so good with an impendingdrill. Now it makes sense.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where is the rest of your invasion force?<|endoftext|>
|1| Invasion force. Me and lovely Nasreen? No. We came for thehumans you took. And to offer the safe return of Alaya. Oh wait, youand she, what is it, same genetic source? Of course you're worried, butdon't be, she's safe.<|endoftext|>
|0| You claim to come in peace, but you hold one of us hostage.<|endoftext|>
|1| Wait, wait, we all want the same thing here.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't negotiate with apes. I'm going to send a clear messageto those on the surface.<|endoftext|>
|1| What's that?<|endoftext|>
|0| Your execution.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| These chambers are all over the city.<|endoftext|>
|0| Urgh. Turn it off, quick. They're not moving.<|endoftext|>
|0| Maybe they're asleep. Let's have another look.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, Amy, don't. Don't.<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy, what are you doing? Get out of there.<|endoftext|>
|0| Some sort of suspended animation. I wonder what these are?<|endoftext|>
|0| The Doctor would know. The Doctor always knows.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hey, look.<|endoftext|>
|0| Wait. I've got it. It's how they came up to the surface. Some sortof powered transport discs. It's our way out of here.<|endoftext|>
|0| Even better. Weapons. Come on, now we can fight back.<|endoftext|>
|0| Which way now?<|endoftext|>
|0| Door at the end.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you sure?<|endoftext|>
|0| No.<|endoftext|>
|0| Wow.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah.<|endoftext|>
|0| We don't stand a chance.<|endoftext|>
|0| We have to find the Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Dad, are you all right? Dad?<|endoftext|>
|0| Ambrose, I'm fine. Leave me alone.<|endoftext|>
|0| You are not fine. Let me, let me look.<|endoftext|>
|0| Get off.<|endoftext|>
|0| Let me look. Oh, my God, Dad.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't know what's happening to me.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's going to be fine. First thing is, bring this temperaturedown. Get you resting.<|endoftext|>
|1| These must be the only ones awake. The others must still be inhibernation.<|endoftext|>
|0| So, why did they go into hibernation in the first place?<|endoftext|>
|1| Their astronomers predicted the planet heading to Earth on acrash course. They a built life underground and put themselves to sleepfor millennia in order to avert what they thought was the apocalypse,when in reality it was the moon coming into alignment with the Earth.<|endoftext|>
|0| How can you know that?<|endoftext|>
|1| Long time ago, I met another tribe of Homo Reptilia. Similar,but not identical.<|endoftext|>
|0| Others of our species have survived?<|endoftext|>
|1| The humans attacked them. They died. I'm sorry.<|endoftext|>
|0| A vermin race.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's the cure?<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|0| I saw what you've done to my dad. What's the cure?<|endoftext|>
|0| Why would I tell you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Because if you don't, I'm going to have to use this on you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Now you reveal yourselves.<|endoftext|>
|0| First you take my son, now you hurt my dad. I'm justprotecting my family here, that's all. I don't want to use it. I wantyou to put things right.<|endoftext|>
|0| Use it.<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|0| Use it on me. But you're too afraid. A woman who can't evenprotect her own child must be too weak to<|endoftext|>
|0| I didn't want to do that. Are you all right? Tell me, what'sthe cure for my dad?<|endoftext|>
|0| He's vermin. He deserves a painful death.<|endoftext|>
|0| I am giving you a chance.<|endoftext|>
|0| I knew it would be you. The one with the most to lose. Theweakest.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm a nurse. You should have told me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ambrose, what have you done?<|endoftext|>
|0| She kept taunting me about Mo and Elliot and you.<|endoftext|>
|0| We have to be better than this.<|endoftext|>
|0| She wouldn't tell me anything. I thought sooner or later she'dgive in. I would have done. I just, I just want my family back, Dad.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm sorry. How do we help you? Tell us what to do.<|endoftext|>
|0| I knew this would come. And soon the war.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're not dying. I'm not going to let you. Not today.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're not authorised to do this.<|endoftext|>
|0| I am authorised to protect the safety of our species while theysleep.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, lovely place. Very gleaming.<|endoftext|>
|0| This is our court and our place of execution.<|endoftext|>
|0| Let them go.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy Pond. There's a girl to rely on.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're covered both ways, so don't try anything clever, buster.<|endoftext|>
|0| Mo.<|endoftext|>
|0| Now let them go, or I shoot.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm warning you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Don't you touch her!<|endoftext|>
|0| And you.<|endoftext|>
|0| All right, Restac, you've made your point.<|endoftext|>
|0| This is now a military tribunal. Go back to your laboratory,Malohkeh.<|endoftext|>
|0| This isn't the way.<|endoftext|>
|0| Prepare them for execution.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, sorry. As rescues go, didn't live up to its potential.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm glad you're okay.<|endoftext|>
|0| Me too. Lizard men, though.<|endoftext|>
|1| Homo Reptilia. They occupied the planet before humans. Now theywant it back.<|endoftext|>
|0| After they've wiped out the human race.<|endoftext|>
|0| Right. Preferred it when I didn't know, to be honest.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why are they waiting? What do you think they're going to dowith us?<|endoftext|>
|0| I didn't know it would go like that, Dad.<|endoftext|>
|0| My little girl, what have you done?<|endoftext|>
|0| What happens now?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, my God.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who is the ape leader?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's them. How are they doing that? How do they know thatwe're in here?<|endoftext|>
|0| Who speaks for the apes?<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't tell them what's happened.<|endoftext|>
|0| I speak for the humans. Some of us, anyway.<|endoftext|>
|0| Do you understand who we are?<|endoftext|>
|0| Sort of. A bit. Not really.<|endoftext|>
|0| We have ape hostages.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor! Amy!<|endoftext|>
|0| Mo! Mo, are you okay?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm fine, love. I've found Elliot.I'm bringing him home.<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy, I thought I'd lost you.<|endoftext|>
|0| What, cause I was sucked into the ground? You're soclingy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Tony Mack!<|endoftext|>
|0| Having fun down there?<|endoftext|>
|0| Not to interrupt, but just a quick reminder to staycalm.<|endoftext|>
|0| Show me Alaya. Show me, and release her immediatelyunharmed, or we kill your friends<|endoftext|>
|0| One by one.<|endoftext|>
|0| No.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ambrose.<|endoftext|>
|0| Steady now, everyone.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ambrose, stop it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Get off me, Dad.<|endoftext|>
|0| We didn't start this.<|endoftext|>
|1| Let Rory deal with this, Ambrose, eh?<|endoftext|>
|0| We are not doing what you say any more.Now, give me back my family.<|endoftext|>
|0| No. Execute the girl.<|endoftext|>
|0| No! No, wait!<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory!<|endoftext|>
|0| She's not speaking for us.<|endoftext|>
|1| There's no need for this.<|endoftext|>
|0| Listen, listen. Whatever you want, we'll do it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Aim.<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy!<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory!<|endoftext|>
|1| Don't do this!<|endoftext|>
|0| No!<|endoftext|>
|0| Fire!<|endoftext|>
|0| Stop! You want to start a war while the rest of us sleep,Restac?<|endoftext|>
|0| The apes are attacking us.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're our protector, not our commander, Restac. Unchain them.<|endoftext|>
|0| I do not recognise your authority at this time, Eldane.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well then, you must shoot me.<|endoftext|>
|0| You woke him to undermine me.<|endoftext|>
|0| We're not monsters. And neither are they.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is it about apes you love so much, hmm?<|endoftext|>
|0| While you slept, they've evolved. I've seen it for myself.<|endoftext|>
|0| We used to hunt apes for sport. When we came underground, theybred and polluted this planet.<|endoftext|>
|0| Shush now, Restac. Go and play soldiers. I'll let you know if Ineed you.<|endoftext|>
|0| You'll need me, then we'll see.<|endoftext|>
|0| Nothing. I've got to get down there.<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory. Hello.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where's Amy?<|endoftext|>
|0| She's fine. Look, here, she is.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, thank God.<|endoftext|>
|0| Keeping you on your toes.<|endoftext|>
|0| No time to chat. Listen, you need to get down here.Go to the drill storeroom. There's a large patch of earth in the middleof the floor. The Silurians are going to send up transport discs tobring you back down using geothermal energy and gravity bubbletechnology. It's how they travel and frankly, it's pretty cool. BringAlaya. We hand her over, we can land this after all. All going to work,promise. Got to dash. Hurry up.<|endoftext|>
|0| The moment we get down there, everything will fall apart.<|endoftext|>
|0| We have to return her. They deserve at least that.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'd say you've got a fair bit to talkabout.<|endoftext|>
|0| How so?<|endoftext|>
|1| You both want the planet. You both have a genuine claim to it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you authorised to negotiate on behalf of humanity?<|endoftext|>
|1| Me? No. But they are.<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|0| No, we're not.<|endoftext|>
|1| Course you are. Amy Pond and Nasreen Chaudhry, speaking for theplanet? Humanity couldn't have better ambassadors. Come on, who hasmore fun than us?<|endoftext|>
|0| Is this what happens, in the future? The planet gets shared? Isthat what we need to do?<|endoftext|>
|0| Er, what are you talking about?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh Nasreen, sorry. Probably worth mentioning at this stage, Amyand I travel in time a bit.<|endoftext|>
|0| Anything else?<|endoftext|>
|1| There are fixed points through time where things must alwaysstay the way they are. This is not one of them. This is an opportunity.A temporal tipping point. Whatever happens today, will change futureevents, create its own timeline, its own reality. The future pivotsaround you, here, now. So do good, for humanity, and for Earth.<|endoftext|>
|0| Right. No pressure there, then.<|endoftext|>
|0| We can't share the planet. Nobody on the surface is going togo for this idea. It is just too big a leap.<|endoftext|>
|1| Come on. Be extraordinary.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay. Bringing things to order. The first meeting ofrepresentatives of the human race and Homo Reptilia is now in session.Ha! Never said that before. That's fab. Carry on. Now, Mo. Let's go andget your son. Oh, you know, humans, and their predecessors shooting thebreeze. Never thought I'd see it.<|endoftext|>
|0| So we get on those, and they take us down through the Earth?<|endoftext|>
|0| Geothermal gravity bubbles, or something.<|endoftext|>
|0| They sent four. She was our only bargaining chip.<|endoftext|>
|0| We have to hand her back.<|endoftext|>
|0| Wait. Before we go down, there's something I've got to do.Dad? I need your help.<|endoftext|>
|0| No. No way.<|endoftext|>
|0| Please, Dad. Just a precaution.<|endoftext|>
|0| I told you, I won't do it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Look at what they did to you.<|endoftext|>
|0| This isn't about me or you.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, it's about your grandson. If you won't do it for me, do itfor Elliot. I know I did wrong, but I can't lose him, Dad.<|endoftext|>
|1| Elliot. There you are.<|endoftext|>
|0| If you've harmed him in any way.<|endoftext|>
|0| Of course not. I only store the young.<|endoftext|>
|1| But why?<|endoftext|>
|0| I took samples of the young, slowed their lifecycles to amillionth of their normal rate so I could study how they grew, whatthey needed, how they lived on the surface.<|endoftext|>
|1| You've been down here working by yourself, all alone?<|endoftext|>
|0| My family, through the millennia, and for the last threehundred years, just me. I never meant to harm your child.<|endoftext|>
|1| Malohkeh, I rather love you.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's safe. We can wake him.<|endoftext|>
|0| Come.<|endoftext|>
|0| Elliot? Ell, it's Dad.<|endoftext|>
|0| Dad.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're safe now.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where are we?<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, I've got to be honest with you, son. We're in the centre ofthe Earth, and there are lizard men.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hi.<|endoftext|>
|0| Wow.<|endoftext|>
|1| Elliot. I'm sorry. I took my eye off you.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's okay. I forgive you.<|endoftext|>
|0| You go on, Doctor. I'll catch up.<|endoftext|>
|0| Storage facility nineteen operational.<|endoftext|>
|0| We lived on the surface of the planet longbefore you did. Our sole purpose has been to return to our rightfulplace.<|endoftext|>
|0| And we've got a planet that can't already sustain the peoplewho live there. And you want to add a whole other species to drainresources<|endoftext|>
|0| As I sat there that day across the table from the humans,the future of both species and of our beloved planet Earth rested inour hands. But as the discussions went on, I began to despair aboutwhether we would ever find any common ground. As ambassadors for ourspecies we all had too much to lose.<|endoftext|>
|0| So, what about the areas that aren't habitable to us? Australianoutback, Sahara desert, Nevada plains. They're all deserted.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, fine, but what happens when their population grows andbreeds and spreads? And anyway, what benefit does humanity get, and howwill we ever sell this to people on the surface?<|endoftext|>
|0| If I could get a word in, maybe I could tell you. You give usspace, we can bring new sources of energy, new methods of water supply,new medicines, scientific advances. We were a great civilisation. Youprovide a place for us on the surface, we'll give you knowledge andtechnology beyond humanity's dreams. If we work together, this planetcould achieve greatness.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay. Now I'm starting to see it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh yeah.<|endoftext|>
|1| Not bad for a first session. More similarities thandifferences.<|endoftext|>
|0| The transport has returned. Your friends are here.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's not right. What are you doing?<|endoftext|>
|0| Protecting our race against the apes.<|endoftext|>
|0| You can't do this.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're a good scientist, Malohkeh, but this is war.<|endoftext|>
|1| Here they are.<|endoftext|>
|0| Mum!<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory!<|endoftext|>
|1| Something's wrong.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, what's he carrying?<|endoftext|>
|1| No. Don't do this. Tell me you didn't do this.<|endoftext|>
|1| What did you do?<|endoftext|>
|0| It was me. I did it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Mum?<|endoftext|>
|0| I just wanted you back.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm sorry. I didn't know. You have to believe me, they'rebetter than this.<|endoftext|>
|0| This is our planet!<|endoftext|>
|1| We had a chance here.<|endoftext|>
|0| Leave us alone.<|endoftext|>
|1| In future, when you talk about this, you tell people there wasa chance but you were so much less than the best of humanity.<|endoftext|>
|0| My sister. Oh. And you want us to trust these apes, Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|1| One woman. She was scared for her family. She is not typical.<|endoftext|>
|0| I think she is.<|endoftext|>
|1| One person let us down, but there is a whole race of dazzling,peaceful human beings up there. You were building something here. Comeon. An alliance could work.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's too late for that, Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| Why?<|endoftext|>
|0| Our drill is set to start burrowing again in fifteen minutes.<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|0| What choice did I have? They had Elliot.<|endoftext|>
|1| Don't do this. Don't call their bluff.<|endoftext|>
|0| Let us go back. And you promise to never come to the surfaceever again. We'll walk away, leave you alone.<|endoftext|>
|0| Execute her.<|endoftext|>
|1| No!<|endoftext|>
|1| Everybody, back to the lab. Run.<|endoftext|>
|0| Execute all the apes.<|endoftext|>
|1| This is a deadly weapon. Stay back.<|endoftext|>
|1| Take everyone to the lab. I'll cover you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Go. Go.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah, ah, Stop right there or I'll use my very deadly weaponagain. One warning, that's all you get. If there can be no deal, you goback into hibernation. All of you, now. This ends here.<|endoftext|>
|0| No. It only ends with our victory.<|endoftext|>
|1| Like I said, one warning.<|endoftext|>
|1| Elliot, you and your dad keep your eyes on that screen. Let meknow if we get company. Amy, keep reminding me how much time I haven'tgot.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay. Um, er, twelve minutes till drill impact.<|endoftext|>
|1| Tony Mack. Sweaty forehead, dilated pupils. What are youhiding?<|endoftext|>
|0| Tony, what happened?<|endoftext|>
|0| Alaya's sting. She said there's no cure. I'm dying, aren't I?<|endoftext|>
|1| You're not dying, you're mutating.<|endoftext|>
|0| How can I stop it?<|endoftext|>
|1| Decontamination program. Might work. Don't know. Eldane, canyou run the program on Tony?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, shedload of those creatures coming our way. We'resurrounded in here.<|endoftext|>
|1| So, question is, how we do stop the drill given we can't getthere in time? Plus, also, how do we get out, given that we'resurrounded? Nasreen, how do you feel about an energy pulse channelledup through the tunnels to the base of the drill?<|endoftext|>
|0| To blow up my life's work?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes. Sorry. No nice way of putting that.<|endoftext|>
|0| Right, well, you're going to have to do it before the drillhits the city, in er<|endoftext|>
|0| Eleven minutes forty seconds.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes. Squeaky bum time.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, but the explosion is going to cave in all the surroundingtunnels, so we have to be out and on the surface by then.<|endoftext|>
|0| But we can't get past Restac's troops.<|endoftext|>
|0| I can help with that. Toxic Fumigation. An emergency failsafemeant to protect my species from infection. A warning signal to occupycryo-chambers. After that, citywide fumigation by toxic gas. Then thecity shuts down.<|endoftext|>
|0| You could end up killing your own people.<|endoftext|>
|0| Only those foolish enough to follow Restac.<|endoftext|>
|1| Eldane, are you sure about this?<|endoftext|>
|0| My priority is my race's survival. The Earth isn't ready for usto return yet.<|endoftext|>
|1| No.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ten minutes, Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| But maybe it should be. So, here's a deal. Everybody listening.Eldane, you activate shutdown. I'll amend the system, set your alarmfor a thousand years time. A thousand years to sort the planet out. Tobe ready. Pass it on. As legend, or prophesy, or religion, but somehowmake it known. This planet is to be shared.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah. I get you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Nine minutes, seven seconds.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes. Fluid controls, my favourite. Energy pulse. Timed, primedand set. Before we go, energy barricade. Need to cancel it out quickly.<|endoftext|>
|0| Fumigation pre-launching.<|endoftext|>
|0| There's not much time for us to get from here to the surface,Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah ha, super-squeaky bum time. Get ready to run for your lives.Now.<|endoftext|>
|0| But the decontamination program on your friend hasn't startedyet.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, go. All of you, go.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, we're not leaving you here.<|endoftext|>
|0| Granddad.<|endoftext|>
|0| Eight minutes ten seconds.<|endoftext|>
|0| Now you look after your mum. You mustn't blame her. She only didwhat she thought was right.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm not going to see you again, am I?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'll be here, always. I love you, boy. You be sure he gets homesafe.<|endoftext|>
|0| This is my fault.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, I can't go back up there. I'd be a freak show. The technologydown here's my only hope.<|endoftext|>
|0| I love you, Dad.<|endoftext|>
|0| Go. Go.<|endoftext|>
|0| Come on.<|endoftext|>
|0| Go on.<|endoftext|>
|0| Toxic fumigation initiated.<|endoftext|>
|0| Return to cryo-chambers.<|endoftext|>
|0| No.<|endoftext|>
|0| Toxic fumigation initiated.<|endoftext|>
|0| No!<|endoftext|>
|0| Return to cryo-chambers.<|endoftext|>
|0| This is not the order.<|endoftext|>
|0| Toxic fumigation initiated.<|endoftext|>
|0| They're going. We're clear.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay, everyone follow Nasreen. Look for a blue box. Get readyto run.<|endoftext|>
|0| Return to cryo-chambers.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm sorry.<|endoftext|>
|0| I thought for a moment, our race and the humans<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, me too.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, We've got less than six minutes.<|endoftext|>
|1| Go. Go! I'm right behind you. Let's go.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm not coming either.<|endoftext|>
|1| What?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, for goodness sake.<|endoftext|>
|0| We're going to hibernate with them, me andTony.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, you must go.<|endoftext|>
|0| I can be decontaminated when we're woken. All the time in theworld.<|endoftext|>
|1| But, Nasreen, you<|endoftext|>
|0| No, this is perfect. I don't want to go. I've got what I wasdigging for. I can't leave when I've only just found it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|0| Thank you, Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| The pleasure was all mine.<|endoftext|>
|0| Come and look for us.<|endoftext|>
|0| So the Doctor sent our warriors back to their rest, on thepromise of future harmony with humans.<|endoftext|>
|0| Immediate evacuation.<|endoftext|>
|0| Other way, idiot.<|endoftext|>
|0| Toxic fumigation is about to commence. Immediate evacuation.<|endoftext|>
|1| Come on.<|endoftext|>
|0| Toxic fumigation is about to commence.<|endoftext|>
|1| No questions, just get in. And yes, I know,it's big. Ambrose, sickbay up the stairs, left, then left again, Getyourself fixed up. Come on. Five minutes and counting. Not here.<|endoftext|>
|1| Not now. It's getting wider.<|endoftext|>
|0| The crack on my bedroom wall.<|endoftext|>
|0| Two parts of space and time that should never havetouched, right here.<|endoftext|>
|1| And the Byzantium. All through the universe, rips in thecontinuum.<|endoftext|>
|0| How can it be following me?<|endoftext|>
|1| Some sort of space-time cataclysm. An explosion, maybe. Bigenough to put cracks in the universe. But what?<|endoftext|>
|0| Four minutes fifty. We have to go.<|endoftext|>
|1| The Angels laughed when I didn't know. Prisoner Zero knew.Everybody knows except me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, just leave it.<|endoftext|>
|1| But where there's an explosion, there's shrapnel.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, you can't put your hand in there.<|endoftext|>
|1| Why not?<|endoftext|>
|1| Argh. I've got something.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is it?<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't know.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|0| She was there when the gas started. She must have been poisoned.<|endoftext|>
|0| You.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay, get in the Tardis, both of you.<|endoftext|>
|0| You did this.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory!<|endoftext|>
|1| Rory, can you hear me?<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't understand.<|endoftext|>
|0| Shush. Don't talk. Doctor, is he okay? We have to get him onto theTardis.<|endoftext|>
|0| We were on the hill. I can't die here.<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't say that.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're so beautiful. I'm sorry.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, help him.<|endoftext|>
|0| If the time energy catches up with you, you'll neverhave been born. It will erase every moment of your existence. You willnever have lived at all. At all. At all. At all.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy, move away from the light. If it touches you, you'll bewiped from history. Amy, move away now.<|endoftext|>
|0| No. I am not leaving him. We have to help him.<|endoftext|>
|1| The light's already around him. We can't help him.<|endoftext|>
|0| I am not leaving him.<|endoftext|>
|1| We have to.<|endoftext|>
|0| No!<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm sorry.<|endoftext|>
|0| Get off me!<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm sorry.<|endoftext|>
|0| Get off me. No.<|endoftext|>
|0| No! No! No! No! Let me out. Please let me out. I need to get toRory. That light. If his body's absorbed, I'll forget him. He'll neverhave existed. You can't let that happen. What are you doing?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, no! No! No! No!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, we can't just leave him there.<|endoftext|>
|1| Keep him in your mind. Don't forget him. If you forget him,you'll lose him forever.<|endoftext|>
|0| When we were on the Byzantium, I still remembered the Clericsbecause I am a time traveller now, you said.<|endoftext|>
|1| They weren't part of your world. This is different. This isyour own history changing.<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't tell me it's going to be okay. You have to make it okay.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's going to be hard, but you can do it, Amy. Tell me aboutRory, eh? Fantastic Rory. Funny Rory. Gorgeous Rory. Amy, listen to me.Do exactly as I say. Amy, please. Keep concentrating. You can do this.<|endoftext|>
|0| I can't.<|endoftext|>
|1| You can. You can do it. I can't help you unless you do. Comeon. We can still save his memory. Come on, Amy. Please. Come on, Amy,come on. Amy, please. Don't let anything distract you. Remember Rory.Keep remembering. Rory's only alive in your memory. You must keep holdof him. Don't let anything distract you. Rory still lives in your mind.<|endoftext|>
|0| What were you saying?<|endoftext|>
|0| I have seen some things today, but this is beyond mad.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor. Five seconds till it all goes up.<|endoftext|>
|0| All Nasreen's work just erased.<|endoftext|>
|0| Good thing she's not here to see it. She's going to give Tony hellwhen they wake up.<|endoftext|>
|0| You could've let those things shoot me.You saved me.<|endoftext|>
|1| An eye for an eye. It's never the way. Now you show your sonhow wrong you were, how there's another way. You make him the best ofhumanity, in the way you couldn't be.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're very quiet. Oh. Hey, look. There I am again. Hello, me.<|endoftext|>
|1| Are you okay?<|endoftext|>
|0| I thought I saw someone else there for a second. I need a holiday.Didn't we talk about Rio?<|endoftext|>
|1| You go in. Just fix this lock. Keeps jamming.<|endoftext|>
|0| You boys and your locksmithery.<|endoftext|>
|0| Now, as my people awaken from their thousand year sleep readyto rise to the surface, my thoughts turn back to the Doctor. The losseshe suffered then and the greater loses that were still to come.<|endoftext|>
|0| So this is one of the last paintings Van Gogh ever painted.Those final months of his life were probably the most astonishingartistic outpouring in history. It was like Shakespeare knocking offOthello, Macbeth and King Lear over the summer hols. And especiallyastonishing because Van Gogh did it with no hope of praise or reward.He is now<|endoftext|>
|0| Thanks for bringing me.<|endoftext|>
|1| You're welcome.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're being so nice to me. Why are you being so nice to me?<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm always nice to you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Not like this. These places you're taking me. Arcadia, the TrojanGardens, now this. I think it's suspicious.<|endoftext|>
|1| What? It's not. There's nothing to be suspicious about.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, I was joking. Why aren't you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Each of these pictures now is worth tens of millions of pounds,yet in his lifetime he was a commercial disaster. Sold only onepainting, and that to the sister of a friend. We have here possibly thegreatest artist of all time, but when he died you could sold his entirebody of work and got about enough money to buy a sofa and a couple ofchairs. If you follow me now<|endoftext|>
|0| Who is it?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's the doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| He was the doctor who took care of Van Gogh when he started togo mad.<|endoftext|>
|0| I knew that.<|endoftext|>
|0| Look. There it is. The actual one.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes. You can almost feel his hand painting it right in front ofyou, carving the colours into shapes. Wait a minute.<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, just look at that.<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|1| Something very not good indeed.<|endoftext|>
|0| What thing very not good?<|endoftext|>
|1| Look there, in the window of the church.<|endoftext|>
|0| Is it a face?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes. And not a nice face at all. I know evil when I see it andI see it in that window.<|endoftext|>
|0| It has changed hands for something in the region of twenty<|endoftext|>
|1| Excuse me. If I can just interrupt for one second. Sorry,everyone. Routine inspection, Ministry of Art and Artiness. So, er<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor Black.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, that's right. Do you know when that picture of the churchwas painted?<|endoftext|>
|0| Ah, well, ah, well, what an interesting question. Most peopleimagine<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm going to have to hurry you. When was it?<|endoftext|>
|0| Exactly?<|endoftext|>
|1| As exactly as you can. Without a long speech, if poss. I'm in ahurry.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, in that case, probably somewhere between the first andthird of June.<|endoftext|>
|1| What year?<|endoftext|>
|0| 1890. Less than a year before, before he killed himself.<|endoftext|>
|1| Thank you, sir. Very helpful indeed. Nice bow-tie. Bow-ties arecool.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yours is very<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, thank you. Keep telling them stuff. We need to go.<|endoftext|>
|0| What about the other pictures?<|endoftext|>
|1| Art can wait. This is life and death. We need to talk toVincent Van Gogh.<|endoftext|>
|1| Right, so, here's the plan. We find Vincent and he leads usstraight to the church and our nasty friend.<|endoftext|>
|0| Easy peasy.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, no. I suspect nothing will be easy with Mister Van Gogh.Now, he'll probably be in the local cafe. Sort of orangey light, chairsand tables outside.<|endoftext|>
|0| Like this?<|endoftext|>
|1| That's the one.<|endoftext|>
|0| Or indeed like that.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, exactly like that.<|endoftext|>
|1| Good evening. Does the name Vincent VanGogh ring a bell?<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't mention that man to me.<|endoftext|>
|1| Excuse me. Do you know Vincent Van Gogh?<|endoftext|>
|0| Unfortunately.<|endoftext|>
|0| Unfortunately?<|endoftext|>
|0| He's drunk, he's mad and he never pays his bills.<|endoftext|>
|1| Good painter, though, eh?<|endoftext|>
|0| Come on! Come on! One painting for one drink. That's nota bad deal.<|endoftext|>
|0| It wouldn't be a bad deal if the painting were any good. Ican't hang that up on my walls. It'd scare the customers half to death.It's bad enough having you in here in person, let alone looming overthe customers day and night in a stupid hat. You pay money or you getout.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'll pay, if you like.<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, if you like, I'll pay for the drink. Or I'll pay for thepainting and you can use the money to pay for the drink.<|endoftext|>
|0| Exactly who are you?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, I'm new in town.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, in that case, you don't know three things. One, I payfor my own drinks, thank you. (laughter) Two, no one ever buys any ofmy paintings or they would be laughed out of town. So if you want tostay in town, I suggest you keep your cash to yourself. And three, yourfriend's cute, but you should keep your big nose out of other people'sbusiness. Come on, just one more drink. I'll pay tomorrow.<|endoftext|>
|0| No.<|endoftext|>
|0| Or, on the other hand, slightly more compassionately, yes?<|endoftext|>
|0| Or, on the other hand, to protect my business from madmen, no.<|endoftext|>
|0| Or?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh look, just shut up, the pair of you. I would like a bottle ofwine, please, which I will then share with whomever I choose.<|endoftext|>
|0| That could be good.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's good by me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Good.<|endoftext|>
|0| That accent of yours. You from Holland like me?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| No.<|endoftext|>
|1| She means yes. So, start again. Hello, I'm the Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| I knew it!<|endoftext|>
|1| Sorry?<|endoftext|>
|0| My brother's always sending doctors, but you won't be able tohelp.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, no, not that kind of doctor. That's incredible, don't youthink, Amy?<|endoftext|>
|0| Absolutely. One of my favourites.<|endoftext|>
|0| One of my favourite whats? You've never seen my work before.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ah yes. One of my favourite paintings that I've ever seen,generally.<|endoftext|>
|0| Then you can't have seen many paintings, then. I know it'sterrible. It's the best I can do. Your hair's orange.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes. So's yours.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes. It was more orange, but now is, of course, less.<|endoftext|>
|1| So. Er, Vincent, painted any churches recently? Any churchyplans? Are churches, chapels, religiousy stuff like that, somethingyou'd like to get into? You know, fairly soon?<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, there is one church I'm thinking of painting when theweather is right.<|endoftext|>
|1| That is very good news.<|endoftext|>
|0| She's been murdered! Help me!<|endoftext|>
|1| That, on the other hand, isn't quite such good news. Come on,Amy, Vincent!<|endoftext|>
|0| She's been ripped to shreds!<|endoftext|>
|1| Please, let me look. I'm a doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who is it?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh no, no, no.<|endoftext|>
|0| Is she dead?<|endoftext|>
|0| Away, all of you vultures. This is my daughter. Giselle. Whatmonster could have done this? Get away from her!<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay, okay.<|endoftext|>
|0| Get that madman out of here!<|endoftext|>
|0| You bring this on us. Your madness! You!<|endoftext|>
|0| He's to blame!<|endoftext|>
|1| Are you all right?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, I'm used to it.<|endoftext|>
|1| Has anything like this murder happened here before?<|endoftext|>
|0| Only a week ago. It's a terrible time.<|endoftext|>
|1| As I thought. As I thought. Come on, we'd better get you home.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where are you staying tonight?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, you're very kind.<|endoftext|>
|1| Dark night. Very starry.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's not much. I live on my own. But you should be okay forone night. One night.<|endoftext|>
|0| We're going to stay with him?<|endoftext|>
|1| Until he paints that church.<|endoftext|>
|0| Watch out. That one's wet.<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry about all the clutter.<|endoftext|>
|1| Some clutter.<|endoftext|>
|0| I've come to accept the only person who's going to love mypaintings is me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Wow. I mean, really. Wow.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, I know it's a mess. I'll have a proper clear out. Imust, I really must.<|endoftext|>
|0| Coffee, anyone?<|endoftext|>
|1| Not for me, actually.<|endoftext|>
|1| You know, you should be careful with these. They're precious.<|endoftext|>
|0| Precious to me. Not precious to anyone else.<|endoftext|>
|0| They're precious to me<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, you're very kind. And kindness is most welcome.<|endoftext|>
|1| Right, so, this church, then. Near here, is it?<|endoftext|>
|0| What is it with you and the church?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, just casually interested in it, you know.<|endoftext|>
|0| Far from casual. It seems to me you never talk about anythingelse. He's a strange one.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay, so, let's talk about you, then. What are you interestedin?<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, look around. Art. It seems to me there's so much more tothe world than the average eye is allowed to see. I believe, if youlook hard, there are more wonders in this universe than you could everhave dreamed of.<|endoftext|>
|1| You don't have to tell me.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's colour. Colour that holds the key. I can hear thecolours. Listen to them. Every time I step outside, I feel nature isshouting at me. Come on. Come and get me. Come on. Come on! Capture mymystery!<|endoftext|>
|1| Maybe you've had enough coffee now. How about some nice calmingtea? Let's get you a cup of chamomile or something, shall we? Amy.Where's Amy?<|endoftext|>
|1| No, no, no!<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy? Amy? What happened?<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't know. I didn't see it. I was having a look at thepaintings out here when something hit me from behind.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's okay. He's gone now and we're here.<|endoftext|>
|0| No! No!<|endoftext|>
|1| Take it easy. Take it easy!<|endoftext|>
|0| What's happening? What's he doing?<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't know.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, dear.<|endoftext|>
|0| Run. Run!<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's not a bad idea. Amy, get back. He'shaving some kind of fit. I'll try to calm him down.<|endoftext|>
|1| Easy, Vincent, easy. Look. Look, look, look. It's me, it's me,it's me. It's the Doctor, look. No-one else is here. So, Vincent<|endoftext|>
|0| Look out!<|endoftext|>
|0| I can't see anything. What is it?<|endoftext|>
|1| That is a good question. Let me help you.<|endoftext|>
|0| You can see him, too?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes. Ish. Well, no. Not really.<|endoftext|>
|0| You couldn't see him?<|endoftext|>
|1| No. No. Oi!<|endoftext|>
|0| He's gone.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, right. Yes. Of course.<|endoftext|>
|1| Right. So he's invisible. What did he looklike?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'll show you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, no, no. No, no!<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's just er, that was quite a good. Oh, no. On you go.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay. Okay. Right. Amy, make Mister Van Gogh comfortable. Don'tlet any invisible monsters in through the front door.<|endoftext|>
|0| But it could be outside, waiting.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, don't worry. I'll risk it. What's the worst that canhappen?<|endoftext|>
|0| You could get torn into pieces by a monster you can't see.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh right, yes, that. Don't worry. I'll be back before you cansay where's he got to now? Not that fast! But pretty fast. See youaround.<|endoftext|>
|1| Right. You in here somewhere? I can't apologise enough. Ithought you were just a useless gadget. I thought you were just anembarrassing present from a dull godmother with two heads and badbreath. Twice. How wrong can a man be?<|endoftext|>
|1| Good. Okay, you're working. Now, see what you make of this. Whois that?<|endoftext|>
|1| No, I know it's not that. There are thousands of them and youcan see them plain as day.<|endoftext|>
|1| No. Definitely not. This is the problem with theimpressionists. Not accurate enough. This would never happen withGainsborough or one of those proper painters. Sorry, Vincent. You willjust have to draw something better.<|endoftext|>
|1| That's better, old girl. Time delay, but you always get itright in the end. Good. Let's find out who this is, then. Well, well,there you are.<|endoftext|>
|1| Maybe not that soon.<|endoftext|>
|1| Take that, and that.<|endoftext|>
|1| Never do that! You scared the living daylights out of me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry, I got bored. As much as you admire his command of colourand shape, it is hard to get fond of Vincent Van Gogh's snoring.<|endoftext|>
|1| Wake, wakey, rise and shine! Breakfast isserved in the courtyard. Whoa! What a morning. Come on. And Amy's got alittle surprise for you.<|endoftext|>
|0| I thought I'd brighten things up to thank youfor saving me last night.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ah.<|endoftext|>
|0| I thought you might like, you know, possibly to perhaps paint themor something? Might be a thought.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, well, they're not my favourite flower.<|endoftext|>
|0| You don't like sunflowers?<|endoftext|>
|0| No, it's not that I don't like them. I find them complex.Always somewhere between living and dying. Half-human as they turn tothe sun. A little disgusting. But, you know, they are a challenge.<|endoftext|>
|1| And one I'm pretty sure you'll rise to. But, moving on, there'ssomething I need to show you.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's him. And the eyes, without mercy.<|endoftext|>
|1| This is a creature called the Krafayis. They travel in space.They travel as a pack, scavenging across the universe. And sometimesone of them gets left behind. And because they are a brutal race, theothers never come back. So, dotted all around the universe areindividual, utterly merciless, utterly abandoned Krafayis. And whatthey do is, well, kill, until they're killed. Which they usuallyaren't. Because other creatures can't see them.<|endoftext|>
|0| But I can.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes. And that's why we are in a unique position today, myfriend, to end this reign of terror. So, feeling like painting thechurch today?<|endoftext|>
|0| What about the monster?<|endoftext|>
|1| Take my word for it. If you paint it, he will come.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay. I'll get my things.<|endoftext|>
|1| In your own time. And I promise you, we'll be out of your hairby this time tomorrow.<|endoftext|>
|1| This is risky.<|endoftext|>
|0| Riskier than normal?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, think about it. This is the middle of Vincent Van Gogh'sgreatest year of painting. If we're not careful, the net result of ourpleasant little trip will be the brutal murder of the greatest artistwho ever lived. Half the pictures on the wall of the Museé D'Orsay willdisappear. And it will be our fault.<|endoftext|>
|1| Vincent? Vincent! Vincent, can I help?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's so clear you cannot help. And when you leave, andeveryone always leaves, I will be left once more with an empty heartand no hope.<|endoftext|>
|1| My experience is that there is, you know, surprisingly, alwayshope.<|endoftext|>
|0| Then your experience is incomplete. I know how it will end.And it will not end well.<|endoftext|>
|1| Come on. Come out. Come on, let's go outside.<|endoftext|>
|0| Get out! You get out. What are you doing here? What are youdoing here?<|endoftext|>
|1| Very well. I'll leave. I'll leave you.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's happening?<|endoftext|>
|1| We're leaving. Everyone knows he's a delicate man. Just monthsfrom now he'll, he'll take his own life.<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't say that. Please.<|endoftext|>
|1| Come on. We have to do this on our own. Go to the church at theright time and hope the monster still turns up.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm ready. Let's go.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm sorry you're so sad.<|endoftext|>
|0| But I'm not. Sometimes these moods torture me for weeks, formonths. But I'm good now. If Amy Pond can soldier on, then so canVincent Van Gogh.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm not soldiering on. I'm fine.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, Amy. I hear the song of your sadness. You've lost someone,I think.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm not sad.<|endoftext|>
|0| They why are you crying? It's all right. I understand.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm not sure I do.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay. Okay. So, now, we must have a plan. When the creaturereturns<|endoftext|>
|0| Then we shall fight him again.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, yes, tick. But last night we were lucky. Amy could havebeen killed. So this time, for a start, we have to make sure I can seehim too.<|endoftext|>
|0| And how are we meant to do that, suddenly?<|endoftext|>
|1| The answer's in this box. I had an excellent, if smelly,godmother.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh no, it's that poor girl from the village.<|endoftext|>
|0| You do have a plan, don't you?<|endoftext|>
|1| No. It's a thing. It's like a plan, but with more greatness.<|endoftext|>
|1| And you'll be sure to tell me if you seeany, you know, monsters.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes. While I may be mad, I'm not stupid.<|endoftext|>
|1| No. Quite. And, to be honest, I'm not sure about mad either. Itseems to me depression is a very complex<|endoftext|>
|0| Shush. I'm working.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, yes. Paint. Do painting! I remember watching Michelangelopainting the Sistine Chapel. Wow! What a whinger. I kept saying to him,look, if you're scared of heights, you shouldn't have taken the jobthen.<|endoftext|>
|0| Shush.<|endoftext|>
|1| And Picasso. What a ghastly old goat. I kept telling him,concentrate, Pablo. It's one eye, either side of the face.<|endoftext|>
|0| Quiet.<|endoftext|>
|1| Is this how time normally passes? Really slowly. In the rightorder. If there's one thing I can't stand, it's an unpunctual alienattack.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you okay? You seem a bit, if I didn't know you better, I'd saynervous.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, there's something not right and I can't quite put myfinger on it.<|endoftext|>
|0| There. He's at the window.<|endoftext|>
|1| Where?<|endoftext|>
|0| There, on the right.<|endoftext|>
|1| As I thought. Come on. I'm going in.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well I'm coming too.<|endoftext|>
|1| No! You're Vincent Van Gogh. No.<|endoftext|>
|0| But you're not armed.<|endoftext|>
|1| I am.<|endoftext|>
|0| What with?<|endoftext|>
|1| Overconfidence, this, and a small screwdriver. I'm absolutelysorted. Just have to find the right crosactic setting and stun him withit. Sonic never fails. Anyway, Amy, only one thought, one simpleinstruction. Don't follow me under any circumstances.<|endoftext|>
|0| I won't.<|endoftext|>
|0| Will you follow him?<|endoftext|>
|0| Of course.<|endoftext|>
|0| I love you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Has he moved?<|endoftext|>
|0| No. Just shifted to the next window. But, wait! He's turningnow.<|endoftext|>
|1| Damn, he's moved.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|1| Argh! I thought I told you. Never mind. We'll talk about itlater. Quick, in here.<|endoftext|>
|1| Absolutely quiet. Can you breath a little quieter, please?<|endoftext|>
|0| No. He's gone past.<|endoftext|>
|1| Shush.<|endoftext|>
|1| I think he heard us.<|endoftext|>
|1| That is impressive hearing he's got. What's less impressive areour chances of survival.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hey! Are you looking for me, sonny? Come on, over here.Because I'm right here waiting for you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Come on. Quickly. Get behind me.<|endoftext|>
|1| Doing anything?<|endoftext|>
|0| Uh uh.<|endoftext|>
|1| Where is he?<|endoftext|>
|0| Where do you think he is, you idiot? Use your head.<|endoftext|>
|1| Anything?<|endoftext|>
|0| Nothing. In fact, he seemed to rather enjoy it.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ooo.<|endoftext|>
|0| Duck! Left.<|endoftext|>
|0| Right, sorry. Your right, my left.<|endoftext|>
|1| This is no good at all. Run like crazy and regroup.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, come on, in here.<|endoftext|>
|1| Right. Okay. Here's the plan. Amy, Rory.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who?<|endoftext|>
|1| Sorry. Er, Vincent.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is the plan?<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't know, actually. My only definite plan is that in futureI'm definitely just using this screwdriver for screwing in screws.<|endoftext|>
|0| Give me a second. I'll be back.<|endoftext|>
|1| I suppose we could try talking to him.<|endoftext|>
|0| Talking to him?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, yes. Might be interesting to know his side of the story.Yes, though maybe he's not really in the mood for conversation right atthis precise moment.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, no harm trying. Listen. Listen! I know you can understandme, even though I know you won't understand why you can understand me.I also know that no one's talked to you for a pretty long stretch, butplease, listen. I also don't belong on this planet. I also am alone. Ifyou trust me, I'm sure we can come to some kind of, you know,understanding. And then, and then, who knows?<|endoftext|>
|0| Over here, mate!<|endoftext|>
|1| What's it up to now?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's moving round the room. Feeling its way around.<|endoftext|>
|1| What?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's like it's trapped. It's moving round the edges of theroom.<|endoftext|>
|0| I can't see a thing.<|endoftext|>
|1| I am really stupid.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, get a grip! This is not a moment to re-evaluate yourself-esteem.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, I am really stupid, and I'm growing old. Why does it attackbut never eat its victims? And why was it abandoned by its pack andleft here to die? And why is it feeling its way helplessly around thewalls of the room? It can't see. It's blind. Yes, and that explains whyit has such perfect hearing!<|endoftext|>
|0| Which unfortunately also explains why it is now turning aroundand heading straight for us.<|endoftext|>
|1| Vincent. Vincent, what's happening?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's charging now. Get back. Get back!<|endoftext|>
|0| He wasn't without mercy at all. He was without sight. I didn'tmean that to happen. I only meant to wound it, I never meant to<|endoftext|>
|1| He's trying to say something.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is it?<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm having trouble making it out, but I think he's saying, I'mafraid. I'm afraid. There, there. Shush, shush. It's okay, it's okay.You'll be fine. Shush.<|endoftext|>
|0| He was frightened, and he lashed out. Like humans who lash outwhen they're frightened. Like the villagers who scream at me. Like thechildren who throw stones at me.<|endoftext|>
|1| Sometimes winning, winning is no fun at all.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hold my hand, Doctor. Try to see what I see. We are so luckywe are still alive to see this beautiful world. Look at the sky. It'snot dark and black and without character. The black is in fact deepblue. And over there, lighter blue. And blowing through the bluenessand the blackness, the wind swirling through the air and then, shining,burning, bursting through, the stars. Can you see how they roar theirlight? Everywhere we look, the complex magic of nature blazes beforeour eyes.<|endoftext|>
|1| I've seen many things, my friend. But you're right. Nothingquite as wonderful as the things you see.<|endoftext|>
|0| I will miss you terribly.<|endoftext|>
|0| I only wish I had something of real valueto give you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, no, no, no. I could never accept such an extraordinarygift.<|endoftext|>
|0| Very well. You're not the first to decline the offer. Amy, theblessed, the wonderful.<|endoftext|>
|0| Be good to yourself, and be kind to yourself.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'll try my best.<|endoftext|>
|0| And maybe give the beard a little trim before you next kisssomeone.<|endoftext|>
|0| I will, I will. And if you tire of this Doctor of yours,return, and we will have children by the dozen.<|endoftext|>
|0| Eek.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, my friend. We have fought monsters together and wehave won. On my own, I fear I may not do as well.<|endoftext|>
|1| Are you thinking what I'm thinking?<|endoftext|>
|0| I was thinking I may need some food or something before we leave.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, no, you're not thinking exactly what I'm thinking.Vincent! I've got something I'd like to show you. Maybe just tidyyourself up a bit first.<|endoftext|>
|1| Now, you know we've had quite a few chats about the possibilitythere might be more to life than normal people imagine?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, brace yourself, Vinny.<|endoftext|>
|0| How come I'm the crazy one, and you two have stayed sane?<|endoftext|>
|0| What do these things all do?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, a huge variety of things. This one here, for instance,plays soothing music. While this one makes a huge amount of noise. Andthis one makes everything go absolutely tonto.<|endoftext|>
|0| And this one?<|endoftext|>
|1| That's a friction contrafibulator!<|endoftext|>
|0| And this?<|endoftext|>
|1| That's ketchup. And that one's mustard.<|endoftext|>
|0| Mmm, nice. Come on, back to the cafe and you can tell me aboutall the wonders of the universe.<|endoftext|>
|1| Good idea. Although, actually, there's a little something I'dlike to show you first.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where are we?<|endoftext|>
|1| Paris, 2010 AD. And this is the mighty Museé D'Orsay, home tomany of the greatest paintings in history.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, that's wonderful.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ignore that. I've got something more important to show you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Take all your chances while you can. You never know whenthey'll pass you by. Like the sum the mathematician cannot solve. Likeme trying my hardest to explain.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's all about your cries and kisses, and those first stepsthat I can't calculate.<|endoftext|>
|1| Doctor Black, we met a few days ago. I asked you about thechurch at Auvers.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, yes. Glad to be of help. You were nice about my tie.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes. And today is another cracker if I may say so. But I justwondered, between you and me, in a hundred words, where do you thinkVan Gogh rates in the history of art?<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, big question, but to me, Van Gogh is the finest painter ofthem all. Certainly, the most popular great painter of all time. Themost beloved. His command of colour, the most magnificent. Hetransformed the pain of his tormented life into ecstatic beauty. Painis easy to portray, but to use your passion and pain to portray theecstasy and joy and magnificence of our world. No one had ever done itbefore. Perhaps no one ever will again. To my mind, that strange, wildman who roamed the fields of Provence was not only the world's greatestartist, but also one of the greatest men who ever lived.<|endoftext|>
|1| Vincent. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Is it too much?<|endoftext|>
|0| No. They are tears of joy. Thank you, sir. Thank you.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're welcome. You're welcome.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry about the beard.<|endoftext|>
|0| This changes everything. I'll step outtomorrow with my easel on my back a different man. I still can'tbelieve that one of the haystacks was in the museum. How embarrassing.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's been a great adventure and a great honour.<|endoftext|>
|0| You've turned out to be the first doctor ever actually to makea difference to my life.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm delighted. I won't ever forget you.<|endoftext|>
|0| And you are sure marriage is out of the question?<|endoftext|>
|0| This time. I'm not really the marrying kind. Come on. Let's goback to the gallery right now.<|endoftext|>
|0| Time can be re-written. I know it can. Comeon! Oh, the long life of Vincent Van Gogh. There'll be hundreds of newpaintings.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm not sure there will.<|endoftext|>
|0| Come on!<|endoftext|>
|0| We have here the last work of Vincent Van Gogh, whocommitted suicide at only thirty seven. He is now acknowledged to beone of the foremost artists of all time. If you follow me now.<|endoftext|>
|0| So you were right. No new paintings. We didn't make a differenceat all.<|endoftext|>
|1| I wouldn't say that. The way I see it, every life is a pile ofgood things and bad things. Hey. The good things don't always softenthe bad things, but vice versa, the bad things don't necessarily spoilthe good things or make them unimportant. And we definitely added tohis pile of good things. And, if you look carefully, maybe we didindeed make a couple of little changes.<|endoftext|>
|0| No Krafayis.<|endoftext|>
|1| No Krafayis.<|endoftext|>
|0| If we had got married, our kids would have had very, very redhair.<|endoftext|>
|1| The ultimate ginger.<|endoftext|>
|0| The ultimate ginge. Brighter than sunflowers.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, Amy, it's definitely not the fifth moon of Cindie Colesta.I think I can see a Ryman's.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy! Amy!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor? It's saying we're on Earth. Essex, Colchester.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor? It's taking off again. Doctor, can you hear me?<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy! Amy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello? Hello, please? Hello? I need your help. There's beenan accident. Please, help me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello?<|endoftext|>
|0| Please, will you help me?<|endoftext|>
|0| Help you? What's wrong?<|endoftext|>
|0| Something terrible's happened. Please help me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Craig, what's that on the ceiling?<|endoftext|>
|0| What's what on the ceiling?<|endoftext|>
|0| That. It's coming from upstairs.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who lives up there again?<|endoftext|>
|0| Just some bloke.<|endoftext|>
|0| So what's the plan tonight? Pizza, booze, telly?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, pizza, booze, telly.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is he doing up there? You put the advert up yet?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, did it today, paper shop window. One furnished roomavailable immediately, shared kitchen, bathroom, with twenty seven yearold male, non-smoker, four hundred pound pcm, per calendar month, suityoung professional.<|endoftext|>
|0| Mmm, sounds ideal. That's your mission in life, Craig. Find mea man.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, otherwise you'll have to settle for me.<|endoftext|>
|0| You'll have to settle for me first.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, Melina again. What? Right. Yeah, but I've kind of gotplans. No, it's nothing important, it's just Craig.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, thanks, Soph.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry. You know what I mean. Okay, I'll talk to Craig. Okay.Now she's having a Dylan crisis on top of the Clare crisis. It could beanother all-nighter. I'm sorry, but I really should go. Do you mind ifI go?<|endoftext|>
|0| No, not at all. No, honestly. Course not. Go.<|endoftext|>
|0| Because I could stay.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, go on.<|endoftext|>
|0| I mean, we've got plans.<|endoftext|>
|0| Just pizza.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, it's just pizza. Okay, right, I'm going.<|endoftext|>
|0| All right, then. Well, er, I'll see you soon.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah.<|endoftext|>
|0| All right. And give me a call, and I hope everything's okay.<|endoftext|>
|0| Thanks, sorry.<|endoftext|>
|0| Just tell her. Just tell her. I love you. I love you. Oh, just.Hey, I don't know if you knew. Oh.<|endoftext|>
|0| Every time.<|endoftext|>
|0| I love you. I love you.<|endoftext|>
|0| I love you. I love you.<|endoftext|>
|0| I love you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, that's good, because I'm your new lodger. Do you know,this is going to be easier than I expected.<|endoftext|>
|0| But I only put the advert up today. I didn't put my address.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, aren't you lucky I came along? More lucky than you know.Less of a young professional, more of an ancient amateur, but franklyI'm an absolute dream.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hang on a minute, mate. I don't know if I want you staying. Andgive me back those keys. You can't have those.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, quite right. Have some rent.<|endoftext|>
|1| That's probably quite a lot, isn't it? Looks like a lot. Is ita lot? I can never tell.<|endoftext|>
|1| Don't spend it all on sweets, unless you like sweets. I likesweets. Ooo.<|endoftext|>
|1| That's how we greet each other nowadays, isn't it? I'm theDoctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me theDoctor, too. Still don't know why.<|endoftext|>
|0| Craig Owens. The Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yep. Who lives upstairs?<|endoftext|>
|0| Just some bloke.<|endoftext|>
|1| What's he look like?<|endoftext|>
|0| Normal. He's very quiet.<|endoftext|>
|0| Usually. Sorry, who are you again? Hello?<|endoftext|>
|0| Excuse me?<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah. I suppose that's dry rot?<|endoftext|>
|0| Or damp. Or mildew.<|endoftext|>
|1| Or none of the above.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'll get someone to fix it.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me theRotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor, don't call me the Rotmeister. This isthe most beautiful parlour I have ever seen. You're obviously a man ofimpeccable taste. I can stay, Craig, can't I? Say I can.<|endoftext|>
|0| You haven't even seen the room.<|endoftext|>
|1| The room?<|endoftext|>
|0| Your room.<|endoftext|>
|1| My room? Oh, yes. My room. My room. Take me to my room.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, this is Mark's old room. He owns the place. Moved outabout a month ago. This uncle he'd never even heard of died and left aload of money in the will.<|endoftext|>
|1| How very convenient. This'll do just right. In fact.<|endoftext|>
|1| No time to lose. I'll take it. Ah you'll want to see mycredentials. There.<|endoftext|>
|1| National Insurance number. NHS number. References.<|endoftext|>
|0| Is that a reference from the Archbishop of Canterbury?<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm his special favourite. Are you hungry? I'm hungry.<|endoftext|>
|0| I haven't got anything in.<|endoftext|>
|1| You've got everything I need for anomelette fines herbes, pour deux. So, who's the girl on the fridge?<|endoftext|>
|0| My friend. Sophie.<|endoftext|>
|1| Girlfriend?<|endoftext|>
|0| A friend who is a girl. There's nothing going on.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, that's completely normal. Works for me.<|endoftext|>
|0| We met at work about a year ago, at the call centre.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh really, a communications exchange? That could be handy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Firm's going down though. The bosses are using a totally rubbishbusiness model. I know what they should do. I got a plan all workedout. But I'm just a phone drone, I can't go running in saying I knowbest. Why am I telling you this? I don't even know you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, I've got one of those faces. People never stop blurtingout their plans while I'm around.<|endoftext|>
|0| Right. Where's your stuff?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, don't worry, it'll materialise. If all goes to plan.<|endoftext|>
|0| Come on, which one? Which one? No. Why won't you land?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, that was incredible. That was absolutely brilliant. Wheredid you learn to cook?<|endoftext|>
|1| Paris, in the eighteenth century. No, hang on, that's notrecent, is it? Seventeenth? No, no, no. Twentieth. Sorry, I'm not usedto doing them in the right order.<|endoftext|>
|0| Has anyone ever told you that you're a bit weird?<|endoftext|>
|1| They never really stop. Ever been to Paris, Craig?<|endoftext|>
|0| Nah. I can't see the point of Paris. I'm not much of atraveller.<|endoftext|>
|1| I can tell from your sofa.<|endoftext|>
|0| My sofa?<|endoftext|>
|1| You're starting to look like it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Thanks, mate, that's lovely. No, I like it here. I'd miss it,I'd miss<|endoftext|>
|1| Those keys.<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|1| You're sort of fondling them.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm holding them.<|endoftext|>
|1| Right.<|endoftext|>
|0| Anyway. These, these are your keys.<|endoftext|>
|1| I can stay?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, you're weird and you can cook. It's good enough for me.Right. Outdoor, front door, your door.<|endoftext|>
|1| My door. My place. My gaff. Ha ha! Yes. Me with a key.<|endoftext|>
|0| And listen, Mark and I, we had an arrangement where if you everneed me out of your hair, just give me a shout, okay?<|endoftext|>
|1| Why would I want that?<|endoftext|>
|0| In case you want to bring someone round. A girlfriend or, aboyfriend?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, I will. I'll shout if that happens. Yes. Something like, Iwas not expecting this! By the way, that. The rot. I've got thestrangest feeling we shouldn't touch it.<|endoftext|>
|1| Earth to Pond, Earth to Pond.<|endoftext|>
|0| Come in, Pond.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry.<|endoftext|>
|1| Could you not wreck my new earpiece, Pond?<|endoftext|>
|0| No, I mean, he seems a laugh. He's a bit weird. Good weird, youknow?<|endoftext|>
|0| And he just happens to have three grand on him in a paperbag?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah.<|endoftext|>
|0| Wait, wait. The Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|0| Craig, what if he's a dealer?<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello. Stop, please. Can you hear me? I need your help.<|endoftext|>
|1| How's the Tardis coping?<|endoftext|>
|0| See for yourself.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ooo, nasty. She's locked in amaterialisation loop, trying to land again<|endoftext|>
|0| But she can't.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hmm. And whatever's stopping her is upstairs in that flat. So, goupstairs and sort it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Please. My little girl's hurt.<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't know what it is yet. Anything thatcan stop the Tardis from landing is big. Scary big.<|endoftext|>
|0| Wait. Are you scared?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm so sorry, but will you help me? Please?<|endoftext|>
|0| Help you?<|endoftext|>
|0| A bow tie? Are you serious?<|endoftext|>
|0| Be fair. Could be even<|endoftext|>
|0| Hang on a sec.<|endoftext|>
|0| What? Craig.<|endoftext|>
|0| Craig?<|endoftext|>
|0| Orange juice. Neocene Arbuckle. Rare tarantula on thetable. Oh.<|endoftext|>
|1| I can't go up there until I know what it isand how to deal with it. And it is vital that this man upstairs doesn'trealise who and what I am. So no sonicking. No advanced technology. Ican only use this because we're on scramble. To anyone else hearingthis conversation, we're talking absolute gibberish.<|endoftext|>
|0| Practical eruption in chicken.Descartes Lombardy spiral.<|endoftext|>
|1| Now all I've got to do is pass as anordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong?<|endoftext|>
|0| Have you seen you?<|endoftext|>
|1| So you're just going to be snide. No helpful hints?<|endoftext|>
|0| Hmm. Well, here's one. Bow tie, get rid.<|endoftext|>
|1| Bow ties are cool. Come on, Amy, I'm anormal bloke. Tell me what normal blokes do.<|endoftext|>
|0| They watch telly, they play football<|endoftext|>
|0| They go down the pub.<|endoftext|>
|1| I could do those things. I don't, but Icould.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hang on. Wait, wait, wait. Amy?<|endoftext|>
|1| Interesting. Localised time loop.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ow. What's all that?<|endoftext|>
|1| Time distortion. Whatever's happeningupstairs is still affecting you.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's stopped. Ish.<|endoftext|>
|0| How about your end?<|endoftext|>
|1| My end's good.<|endoftext|>
|0| So<|endoftext|>
|0| Doesn't sound great, but nothing to worryabout?<|endoftext|>
|1| No, no, no, not really. Just keep thezigzag plotter on full.<|endoftext|>
|0| That'll protect you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ow.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy, I said the zigzag plotter.<|endoftext|>
|0| I pulled the zigzag plotter.<|endoftext|>
|1| What, you're standing with the door behindyou?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay, take two steps to your right and pullit again.<|endoftext|>
|1| Now, I must not use the sonic. I've got work to do.<|endoftext|>
|0| Need to pick up a few items.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hey.<|endoftext|>
|1| Shush. Don't get comfortable.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ta ra ra boom de ay quanda rilo, something is happening.)<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello?<|endoftext|>
|0| How long are you going to be in there?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, sorry. I like a good soak.<|endoftext|>
|0| What the hell was that?<|endoftext|>
|1| What did you say?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm just going to go upstairs. See if he'sokay.<|endoftext|>
|1| Sorry?<|endoftext|>
|1| What did you say?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes? Hello?<|endoftext|>
|1| Craig?<|endoftext|>
|1| Ow.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's me from downstairs. I heard a big bang.<|endoftext|>
|1| No choice. It's sonicking time.<|endoftext|>
|0| Thank you, Craig, but I don't need your help.<|endoftext|>
|1| What happened, what's going on?<|endoftext|>
|0| Is that my toothbrush?<|endoftext|>
|1| Correct. You spoke to the man upstairs?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah.<|endoftext|>
|1| What did he look like?<|endoftext|>
|0| More normal than you do at the moment, mate. What are you doing?<|endoftext|>
|1| I thought you might be in trouble.<|endoftext|>
|0| Thanks. Well, if I ever am, you can come and save me with mytoothbrush.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh! Hello.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah! Hello. The Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Right.<|endoftext|>
|1| You must be Sophie.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh. Oh.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, Dom's in Malta. There's nobody around.Hang on a sec. We've got a match today, pub league. We're one down ifyou fancy it?<|endoftext|>
|1| Pub league. A drinking competition?<|endoftext|>
|0| No, football. Play football.<|endoftext|>
|1| Football. Football. Yes, blokes play football. I'm good atfootball, I think.<|endoftext|>
|0| You've saved my life. I've got somebody. Yeah, all right, I'llsee you down there. Hey, Soph.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hey, I thought I'd come early and meet your new flat mate.<|endoftext|>
|1| Do you play, Sophie?<|endoftext|>
|0| No, Soph just stands on the sidelines. She's my mascot.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm your mascot? Mascot?<|endoftext|>
|0| I didn't say I was your date.<|endoftext|>
|0| Neither did I.<|endoftext|>
|1| Better get dressed.<|endoftext|>
|0| The spare kit's just in the bottom drawer.<|endoftext|>
|1| Bit of a mess.<|endoftext|>
|0| What do you think?<|endoftext|>
|0| You didn't say he was gorgeous.<|endoftext|>
|0| You unlocked the door. How did you do that? Those are your keys.You must have left them last time you came here.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, but I. How do you know these are my keys?<|endoftext|>
|0| I've been holding them.<|endoftext|>
|0| I have got another set.<|endoftext|>
|1| You've got two sets of keys to someone else's house?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah?<|endoftext|>
|1| I see. You must like it here too.<|endoftext|>
|1| So, I'm going out. If I hang about the house all the time, himupstairs might get suspicious and notice me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Football. Okay, well done. That is normal.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, football. All outdoorsy.<|endoftext|>
|1| Now, football's the one with the sticks,isn't it?<|endoftext|>
|0| What are you actually called? What's yourproper name?<|endoftext|>
|1| Just call me the Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah.<|endoftext|>
|0| I can't go up to these guys and say hey, this is my new flatmate, he's called the Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| Why not?<|endoftext|>
|0| Because it's weird.<|endoftext|>
|0| All right, Craig. Soph. All right, mate.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hello, I'm Craig's new flat mate. I'm called the Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| All right, Doctor. I'm Sean. So, where are you strongest?<|endoftext|>
|1| Arms.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, he means what position on the field.<|endoftext|>
|1| Not sure. The front? The side? Below.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you any good though?<|endoftext|>
|1| Let's find out.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, we're going to win.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's not bad. Yes! Go!<|endoftext|>
|0| One two. One two.<|endoftext|>
|0| Go on, Doctor! Go on, Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor! Doctor! You're brilliant. You're amazing.<|endoftext|>
|0| Come on, Craig. Catch up, mate.<|endoftext|>
|0| Come on, Craig. Show them what you've got.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh yes, I love this game.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor! Doctor! Doctor! Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|0| Please can you help me? Can you help me, please? Can youhelp me?<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello?<|endoftext|>
|0| I've lost my mum and I don't know where she is. Please can youhelp me?<|endoftext|>
|0| Help you? You poor thing. What's happened?<|endoftext|>
|0| Can you help me find her?<|endoftext|>
|0| You are so on the team. Next week we've gotthe Crown and Anchor. We're going to annihilate them.<|endoftext|>
|1| Annihilate? No. No violence, do you understand me? Not whileI'm around. Not today, not ever. I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm,and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah.<|endoftext|>
|1| Lovely. What sort of time?<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy?<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's happening again. Worse.<|endoftext|>
|1| What does the scanner say?<|endoftext|>
|0| A lot of nines. Is it good that they're nines?Tell me it's good that they're all nines.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, yes, it's, it's good. Zigzag plotter.Zigzag plotter, Amy.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy? Are you there?<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes. Hello.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, thank heavens. I thought for a momentthe Tardis had been flung off into the vortex<|endoftext|>
|0| With you inside it, lost forever.<|endoftext|>
|0| What, you mean that could actually happen?<|endoftext|>
|0| You have got to get me out of here.<|endoftext|>
|1| How are the numbers?<|endoftext|>
|0| All fives.<|endoftext|>
|1| Fives? Even better.<|endoftext|>
|0| Still, it means the effect's almostunbelievably powerful and dangerous, but don't worry.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hang on, okay?<|endoftext|>
|0| Hey.<|endoftext|>
|0| I've got some rewiring to do.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hang on.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hello, flat mate.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hey, man. Er, listen. Er, Sophie's coming round tonight and Iwas wondering if you could give us some space?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, don't mind me. You won't even know I'm here.<|endoftext|>
|1| That's the idea.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, perfect! What a beauty.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's got bigger.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, yeah.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are we going out?<|endoftext|>
|0| I've had a bit of a weird day. Can we do pizza booze telly?<|endoftext|>
|0| Great, love it. Wait. No Melina, no crises, no interruptions.<|endoftext|>
|0| Great. Excellent. Er, Soph. I've, I think.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where's this going?<|endoftext|>
|0| I think that we should<|endoftext|>
|0| Mmm?<|endoftext|>
|1| Hello.<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|1| Whoops. Sorry. Don't worry, I wasn't listening. In a world ofmy own down there.<|endoftext|>
|0| I thought you were going out?<|endoftext|>
|1| Just re-connecting all the electrics. It's a real mess. Where'sthe on switch for this?<|endoftext|>
|0| He really is just on his way out.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, I don't mind. I mean, if you don't mind.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't mind. Why would I mind?<|endoftext|>
|0| Then stay. Have a drink with us.<|endoftext|>
|1| What? Do I have to stay now?<|endoftext|>
|0| Do you want to stay?<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't mind.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay.<|endoftext|>
|0| Great.<|endoftext|>
|0| Because life can seem pointless, you know, Doctor. Work,weekend, work, weekend. And there's six billion people on the planetdoing pretty much the same.<|endoftext|>
|1| Six billion people. Watching you two at work, I'm starting towonder where they all come from.<|endoftext|>
|0| Huh? What do you mean by that?<|endoftext|>
|1| So then, the call centre. That's no good, then. What do youreally want to do?<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't laugh. I only ever told Craig about it. I want to worklooking after animals. Maybe abroad? I saw thisorangutan sanctuary on telly.<|endoftext|>
|1| What's stopping you?<|endoftext|>
|0| She can't. You need loads of qualifications.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, true. Plus it's scary. Everyone I know lives round here.Like, Craig got offered a job in London. Better money. He didn't takeit.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's wrong with staying here? I can't see the point of London.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, perhaps that's you, then. Perhaps you'll just have tostay here, secure and a little bit miserable, till the day you drop.Better than trying and failing, eh?<|endoftext|>
|0| You think I'd fail?<|endoftext|>
|1| Everybody's got dreams, Sophie. Very few are going to achievethem, so why pretend?<|endoftext|>
|1| Perhaps, in the whole wide universe, a call centre about iswhere you should be.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why are you saying that? That's horrible.<|endoftext|>
|1| Is it true?<|endoftext|>
|0| Of course it's not true. I'm not staying in a call centre allmy life. I can do anything I want.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, yeah. Right. Oh, my God. Did you see what he just did?<|endoftext|>
|0| No, sorry, what's happening? Are you going to live with monkeysnow?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's a big old world, Sophie. Work out what's really keepingyou here, eh?<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't know. I don't know.<|endoftext|>
|0| So, are you going to be taking off then? Seeing the world?<|endoftext|>
|0| What, do you think I should?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah. Like the Doctor says, what's, what's keeping you here?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, exactly. What. Bye.<|endoftext|>
|0| See you.<|endoftext|>
|0| See you in a bit.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah.<|endoftext|>
|1| Right. Shield's up. Let's scan.<|endoftext|>
|0| What are you getting?<|endoftext|>
|1| Upstairs.<|endoftext|>
|0| No traces of high technology. Totally<|endoftext|>
|1| Normal? No, no, no, no, no, it can't be.It's too normal.<|endoftext|>
|0| Only for you could too normal be a problem.You said I could be lost forever. Just go upstairs.<|endoftext|>
|1| Without knowing and get myself killed? Thenyou really are lost. If I could just get a look in there. Hold on. Usethe data bank. Get me the plans of this building. I want to know itshistory, the layout, everything.<|endoftext|>
|0| ]Meanwhile, I shall recruit a spy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Rotmeister.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ow! Ow.<|endoftext|>
|1| Craig? Craig? Breakfast. It's normal. Craig?<|endoftext|>
|1| Craig. Craig, Craig, Craig. I told you notto touch it. Look, what's that?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's an unfamiliar and obviously poisonous substance. Oh, Iknow what'd be really clever, I'll stick my hand in it. Come on, Craig,breathe.<|endoftext|>
|1| Come on, Craig, breathe. Thems are healthy footballer's lungs.<|endoftext|>
|1| Right, reverse the enzyme decay. Excite the tannin molecules.<|endoftext|>
|0| I've got to go to work.<|endoftext|>
|1| On no account. You need rest. One more.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's the planning meeting. It's important.<|endoftext|>
|1| You're important. You're going to be fine, Craig.<|endoftext|>
|0| What? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, afternoon.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm so sorry, Michael. I don't know what happened. I've got noexcuse.<|endoftext|>
|1| I think that's not what my screen is telling me, Mister Lang.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's he doing here? What are you doing here?<|endoftext|>
|1| If that's your attitude, Mister Lang, please take your customelsewhere.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, no, no, that's one of my best clients.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hello, Craig. How are you feeling? Had some time to kill. I wascurious. Never worked in an office. Never worked in anywhere.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're insane.<|endoftext|>
|0| Leave off the Doctor. I love the Doctor. He was brilliant inthe planning meeting.<|endoftext|>
|0| You went to the planning meeting?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes. I was your representative. We don't need Mister Lang anymore. Rude Mister Lang.<|endoftext|>
|0| Here you go, and I found some custard creams.<|endoftext|>
|1| Sophie, my hero.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hi, Craig. I went on the web, applied for a wildlife charitything. They said I could always start as a volunteer straight away.Should I do it?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, great. Yeah, good. Go for it.<|endoftext|>
|1| You look awful. About turn. Bed. Now. Who next? Oh, yes. Hello,Mister Joergensen. Can you hold? I have to eat a biscuit.<|endoftext|>
|0| What the hell?<|endoftext|>
|1| Have you been upstairs? Yes?<|endoftext|>
|0| You can do it. Show me what's up there? What's behind thatdoor? Try to show me. Oh, but that doesn't make sense. Ever see anyonego up there? Lots of people? Good, good. What kind of people?<|endoftext|>
|1| People who never came back down. Oh, that's bad. That's verybad.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, hello.<|endoftext|>
|0| I can't take this any more. I want you to go.<|endoftext|>
|0| You can have this back and all.<|endoftext|>
|1| What have I done?<|endoftext|>
|0| For a start, talking to a cat.<|endoftext|>
|1| Lots of people talk to cats.<|endoftext|>
|0| And everybody loves you, and you're better at football than me,and my job, and now Sophie's all oh, monkeys, monkeys, and then there'sthat.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's art. A statement on modern society,Ooo, ain't modern society awful.<|endoftext|>
|0| Me and you, it's not going to work out. You've only been herethree days. These have been the three weirdest days of my life.<|endoftext|>
|1| Your days will get a lot weirder if I go.<|endoftext|>
|0| It was good weirdness. It's not, it's bad weird. I can't do thisany more.<|endoftext|>
|1| Craig, I can't leave this place. I'm like you, I can't see thepoint of anywhere else. Madrid? Ha, what a dump. I have to stay.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, you don't. You have to leave.<|endoftext|>
|1| I can't go.<|endoftext|>
|0| Just get out!<|endoftext|>
|1| Right. Only way. I'm going to show you something, but shush.Really, shush. Oh, I am going to regret this. Okay, right. First,general background.<|endoftext|>
|0| Argh.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ow.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're a<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| From<|endoftext|>
|1| Shush.<|endoftext|>
|0| You've got a Tardis.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes. Shush. Eleventh. Right. Okay, specific detail.<|endoftext|>
|0| Argh.<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy! Amy!<|endoftext|>
|0| You saw my ad in the paper shop window.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, with this right above it. Which is odd, because Amy hasn'twritten it yet.<|endoftext|>
|1| Time travel. It can happen.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's a scanner. You used non-technological technology ofLammasteen!<|endoftext|>
|1| Shut up!<|endoftext|>
|0| Please can you help me?<|endoftext|>
|0| Hi.<|endoftext|>
|0| Please, will you help me?<|endoftext|>
|0| What's the matter, my love? Help you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Argh.<|endoftext|>
|1| I am never, never doing that ever, ever again.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's Amy Pond.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, of course, you can understand us now. Hurrah. Got thoseplans yet?<|endoftext|>
|0| Still searching for them.<|endoftext|>
|0| I've worked it out, with psychic help from a cat.<|endoftext|>
|0| A cat?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes. I know he's got a time engine in theflat upstairs.<|endoftext|>
|0| He's using innocent people to try andlaunch it.<|endoftext|>
|1| Whenever he does, they get burnt up, hencethe stain on your ceiling.<|endoftext|>
|0| From the ceiling.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well done, Craig.<|endoftext|>
|0| And you, Miss Pond, nearly get thrownoff into the Vortex.<|endoftext|>
|0| Lovely.<|endoftext|>
|0| People are dying up there? People are dying. People are dying.People are dying.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy.<|endoftext|>
|0| They're being killed.<|endoftext|>
|1| Someone's up there.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|1| Hang on. Craig, come on. Someone's dying up there.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sophie. It's Sophie that's dying up there! It's Sophie!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor! Argh!<|endoftext|>
|0| Where's Sophie?<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy?<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you upstairs?<|endoftext|>
|1| Just going in.<|endoftext|>
|0| But you can't be upstairs.<|endoftext|>
|1| Of course I can be upstairs.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, I've got the plans. You cannot beupstairs, it's a one-storey building.<|endoftext|>
|0| There is no upstairs.<|endoftext|>
|0| What? What?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh. Oh, of course. The time engine isn't in the flat, the timeengine is the flat. Someone's attempt to build a Tardis.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, there's always been an upstairs.<|endoftext|>
|1| Has there? Think about it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes. No. I don't<|endoftext|>
|1| Perception filter. It's more than a disguise. It tricks yourmemory.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sophie! Sophie! Oh, my God, Sophie!<|endoftext|>
|0| Craig.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's controlling her. It's willing her to touch the activator.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's not going to have her.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah, deadlock seal.<|endoftext|>
|0| You've got to do something.<|endoftext|>
|1| What? Why's it let her go? So, okay.<|endoftext|>
|0| You will help me.<|endoftext|>
|1| Right. Stop. Crashed ship, let's see. Hello, I'm Captain TroyHandsome of International Rescue. Please state the nature of youremergency.<|endoftext|>
|0| The ship has crashed. The crew are dead. A pilot isrequired.<|endoftext|>
|1| You're the emergency crash program. A hologram. What, you'vebeen luring people up here so you can try them out?<|endoftext|>
|0| You will help me. You will help me. You will help me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Craig, what is this? Where am I?<|endoftext|>
|1| Hush. Human brains aren't strong enough, they just burn. Butyou're stupid, though. You just keep trying.<|endoftext|>
|0| Seventeen people have been tried. Six billion four hundredthousand and twenty six remain.<|endoftext|>
|0| Seriously, what is going on?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, for goodness sake. The top floor of Craig's building is inreality an alien space ship intent on slaughtering the population ofthis planet. Any questions? No, good.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, I have questions.<|endoftext|>
|0| The correct pilot has now been found.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, I was a bit worried that you were going to say that.<|endoftext|>
|0| He means you, Doctor, doesn't he?<|endoftext|>
|0| The correct pilot has been found. The correct pilot has beenfound. The correct pilot has been found.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's happening?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's pulling me in. I'm the new pilot.<|endoftext|>
|0| Could you do it?<|endoftext|>
|0| Could you fly the ship safely?<|endoftext|>
|1| No, I'm way too much for this ship. My handtouches that panel, the planet doesn't blow up, the whole solar systemdoes.<|endoftext|>
|0| The correct pilot has been found.<|endoftext|>
|1| No. Worst choice ever, I promise you. Stop this.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's getting worse.<|endoftext|>
|1| It doesn't want everyone. Craig, it didn'twant you.<|endoftext|>
|0| I spoke to him and he said I couldn't help him.<|endoftext|>
|1| It didn't want Sophie before but now it does. What's changed?Argh. No. No, I gave her the idea of leaving. It's a machine that needsto leave. It wants people who want to escape. And you don't want toleave, Craig. You're Mister Sofa Man.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|1| Craig, you can shut down the engine. Putyour hand on the panel and concentrate on why you want to stay.<|endoftext|>
|0| Craig, no.<|endoftext|>
|0| Will it work?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you sure?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Is that a lie?<|endoftext|>
|1| Of course it's a lie.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's good enough for me. Geronimo! Argh!<|endoftext|>
|0| Craig!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|1| Craig, what's keeping you here? Think about everything thatmakes you want to stay here. Why don't you want to leave?<|endoftext|>
|0| Sophie. I don't want to leave Sophie. I can't leave Sophie. Ilove Sophie.<|endoftext|>
|0| I love you, too, Craig, you idiot.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|0| Honestly, do you mean that?<|endoftext|>
|0| Of course I mean it. Do you mean it?<|endoftext|>
|0| I've always meant it. Seriously though, do you mean it?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ugh.<|endoftext|>
|0| What about the monkeys?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, not now, not again. Craig, the planet'sabout to burn. For God's sake, kiss the girl.<|endoftext|>
|0| Kiss the girl!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|0| You've done it. Ha ha!<|endoftext|>
|0| You've done it. Oh, now the screen's justzeros. Now it's minus ones, minus twos, minus threes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Big yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Help me. Help me. Help me. Help me.<|endoftext|>
|1| Big no.<|endoftext|>
|0| Help me. Help me. Help me. Help me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Did we switch it off?<|endoftext|>
|1| Emergency shutdown. It's imploding. Everybody out, out, out!<|endoftext|>
|0| Help me. Help me. Help me. Help me. Help me Help me. Helpme. Help me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|0| Help me. Help me. Help me. Help me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Look at them. Didn't they see that? The whole top floor justvanished.<|endoftext|>
|1| Perception filter. There never was a top floor.<|endoftext|>
|0| So have we spoiled our friendship, then?<|endoftext|>
|0| Totally ruined it.<|endoftext|>
|0| And what about the monkeys? We could save them together, youknow. Do whatever we want. I could see the point of Paris if you werethere with me.<|endoftext|>
|0| First, let's destroy our friendship completely.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oi.<|endoftext|>
|0| What, you're trying to sneak off?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, well, you were sort of busy.<|endoftext|>
|0| I want you to keep these.<|endoftext|>
|1| Thank you. Because I might pop back soon, have another littlestay.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, you won't. I've been in your head, remember. I still wantyou to keep them.<|endoftext|>
|1| Thank you, Craig.<|endoftext|>
|0| Thank you, Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| Sophie. Now then. Six billion four hundred thousand and twentysix people in the world. That's the number to beat.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah.<|endoftext|>
|1| Back in time. You need to go to the papershop and leave that note for me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Right little matchmaker, aren't you? Can't you find me a fellow?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, rectifier's playing up again Hold on. You write the noteand I'll change that will.<|endoftext|>
|0| You got a pen?<|endoftext|>
|1| Make sure it's a red pen.<|endoftext|>
|0| Vincent, can you hear me? Please.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's not enough he goes drinking all round the town. Now thewhole neighbourhood has to listen to his screaming.<|endoftext|>
|0| He's very ill, Madame Vernet.<|endoftext|>
|0| Look at this, even worse than his usual rubbish. What's itsupposed to be?<|endoftext|>
|0| It was found behind the wall, in an attic in France. It'sgenuine. It's a Van Gogh.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why bring it to me?<|endoftext|>
|0| Because it's obviously a message, and you can see who it'sfor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Can't say I understand it.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're not supposed to understand it, Prime Minister. You'resupposed to deliver it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Cell four two six. The Doctor? Do you mean Doctor Song?<|endoftext|>
|0| Give me that. Seriously, just give it to me. I'm entitled tophone calls.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|0| No, and neither are you. Where is he?<|endoftext|>
|0| You're phoning the Time Vortex. It doesn't always work. Butthe Tardis is smart. She's re-routed the call.<|endoftext|>
|0| Talk quickly. This connection will last lessthan a minute.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor Song. Are you finished with that?<|endoftext|>
|0| You're new here, aren't you?<|endoftext|>
|0| First day.<|endoftext|>
|0| Then I'm very sorry.<|endoftext|>
|0| Stay exactly where you are.<|endoftext|>
|0| She had the lipstick. The hallucinogenic lipstick. She tried touse it on me. Your tricks don't work in here, Doctor Song.<|endoftext|>
|0| This is the Royal Collection, and I'm the bloody Queen. What areyou doing here?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's about the Doctor, Ma'am. You met him once, didn't you? Iknow he came here.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|0| He's in trouble. I need to find him.<|endoftext|>
|0| Then why are you stealing a painting?<|endoftext|>
|0| Look at it. I need to find the Doctor, and I need to show himthis.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well now, word on the Belt is you're looking for time travel.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you selling?<|endoftext|>
|0| A vortex manipulator, fresh off the wrist of a handsome TimeAgent.<|endoftext|>
|0| I said off the wrist.<|endoftext|>
|0| Not cheap, Doctor Song. Have you brought me a pretty toy?<|endoftext|>
|0| This is a Calisto Pulse. It can disarm micro-explosives from upto twenty feet.<|endoftext|>
|0| What kind of micro-explosives?<|endoftext|>
|0| The kind I just put in your wine.<|endoftext|>
|1| Vavoom!<|endoftext|>
|0| Va-what?<|endoftext|>
|1| I can't believe I've never thought of this before. It's genius.Right. Landed. Come on.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where are we?<|endoftext|>
|1| Till today.<|endoftext|>
|0| What happens today?<|endoftext|>
|1| Us. The Tardis can translate anything. All we have to do isopen the doors and read the very first words in recorded history.<|endoftext|>
|0| Vavoom.<|endoftext|>
|0| Right place?<|endoftext|>
|1| Just followed the co-ordinates on the cliff face. Earth.Britain. one oh two am. No, pm. No, AD.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's a Roman Legion.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, yeah. The Romans invaded Britain several times duringthis period.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, I know. My favourite topic at school. Invasion of the hotItalians. Yeah, I did get marked down for the title.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hail, Caesar!<|endoftext|>
|1| Hi.<|endoftext|>
|0| Welcome to Britain. We are honoured by your presence.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, you're only human. Arise, Roman person.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why does he think you're Caesar?<|endoftext|>
|0| Cleopatra will see you now.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello, sweetie.<|endoftext|>
|0| River. Hi.<|endoftext|>
|1| You graffitied the oldest cliff face in the universe.<|endoftext|>
|0| You wouldn't answer your phone.<|endoftext|>
|1| What's this?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's a painting. Your friend Vincent. One of his final works. Hehad visions, didn't he? I thought you ought to know about this one.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor? Doctor, what is this?<|endoftext|>
|0| Why is it exploding?<|endoftext|>
|0| I assume it's some kind of warning.<|endoftext|>
|0| What, something's going to happen to the Tardis?<|endoftext|>
|0| It might not be that literal. Anyway, this is where he wantedyou. Date and map reference on the door sign, see?<|endoftext|>
|1| Does it have a title?<|endoftext|>
|0| The Pandorica Opens.<|endoftext|>
|0| Come on. Ya!<|endoftext|>
|0| The Pandorica? What is it?<|endoftext|>
|0| A box, a cage, a prison. It was built to contain the most fearedthing in all the universe.<|endoftext|>
|1| And it's a fairy tale, a legend. It can't be real.<|endoftext|>
|0| If it is real, it's here and it's opening, and it's gotsomething to do with your Tardis exploding. Hidden, obviously. Buriedfor centuries. You won't find it on a map.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, but if you buried the most dangerous thing in the universe,you'd want to remember where you put it.<|endoftext|>
|0| How come it's not new?<|endoftext|>
|0| Because it's already old. It's been here thousands of years. Noone knows exactly how long.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, this Pandorica thing. Last time we saw you, you warned usabout it, after we climbed out of the Byzantium.<|endoftext|>
|0| Spoilers.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, but you told the Doctor you'd see him again when the Pandoricaopens.<|endoftext|>
|0| Maybe I did, but I haven't yet. But I will have. Doctor, I'mpicking up fry particles everywhere. Energy weapons discharged on thissite.<|endoftext|>
|1| If the Pandorica is here, it contains the mightiest warrior inhistory. Now, half the galaxy would want a piece of that. Maybe evenfight over it. We need to get down there.<|endoftext|>
|0| Right then. Ready.<|endoftext|>
|1| The Underhenge.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's a Pandorica.<|endoftext|>
|0| More than just a fairy tale.<|endoftext|>
|1| There was a goblin, or a trickster, or a warrior. A nameless,terrible thing, soaked in the blood of a billion galaxies. The mostfeared being in all the cosmos. And nothing could stop it, or hold it,or reason with it. One day it would just drop out of the sky and teardown your world.<|endoftext|>
|0| How did it end up in there?<|endoftext|>
|1| You know fairy tales. A good wizard tricked it.<|endoftext|>
|0| I hate good wizards in fairy tales. They always turn out to behim.<|endoftext|>
|0| So, it's kind of like Pandora's Box, then? Almost the same name.<|endoftext|>
|1| Sorry, what?<|endoftext|>
|0| The story. Pandora's Box, with all the worst things in the worldin it. That was my favourite book when I was a kid. What's wrong?<|endoftext|>
|1| Your favourite school topic. Your favourite story. Never ignorea coincidence, unless you're busy. In which case, always ignore acoincidence.<|endoftext|>
|0| So can you open it?<|endoftext|>
|1| Easily. Anyone can break into a prison. But I'd rather knowwhat I'm going to find first.<|endoftext|>
|0| You won't have long to wait. It's already opening. There arelayers and layers of security protocols in there, and they're beingdisabled one by one. Like it's being unlocked from the inside.<|endoftext|>
|1| How long do we have?<|endoftext|>
|0| Hours at the most.<|endoftext|>
|1| What kind of security?<|endoftext|>
|0| Everything. Deadlocks, time stops, matter lines.<|endoftext|>
|1| What could need all that?<|endoftext|>
|0| What could get past all that?<|endoftext|>
|1| Think of the fear that went into making this box. What couldinspire that level of fear? Hello, you. Have we met?<|endoftext|>
|0| So why would it start to open now?<|endoftext|>
|1| No idea.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ahem, And how could Vincent have known about it? He won't even beborn for centuries.<|endoftext|>
|1| The stones. These stones are great big transmitters,broadcasting a warning to everyone, everywhere, to every time zone. ThePandorica is opening.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, everyone everywhere?<|endoftext|>
|1| Even poor Vincent heard it, in his dreams. But what's in there?What could justify all this?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, everyone?<|endoftext|>
|1| Anything that powerful, I'd know about it. Why don't I know?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, you said everyone could hear it. So who else is coming?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh? Oh, what?<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay. If it is basically a transmitter, we should be able tofold back the signal.<|endoftext|>
|1| Doing it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doing what?<|endoftext|>
|0| Stonehenge is transmitting. It's been transmitting for a while,so who heard?<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay, should be feeding back to you now. River, what's outthere?<|endoftext|>
|0| Give me a moment.<|endoftext|>
|1| River, quickly. Anything?<|endoftext|>
|0| Around this planet there are at least ten thousand starships.<|endoftext|>
|0| At least?<|endoftext|>
|0| Ten thousand, a hundred thousand, a million, I don't know.There's too many readings.<|endoftext|>
|1| What kind of starships?<|endoftext|>
|0| Maintaining orbit.<|endoftext|>
|0| I obey. Shield cover compromised on ion sectors.<|endoftext|>
|0| Daleks. Those are Daleks.<|endoftext|>
|0| Scan detects no temporal activity.<|endoftext|>
|0| Soft grid scan commencing.<|endoftext|>
|0| Reverse thrust for compensatory stabilisation.<|endoftext|>
|0| Daleks, Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Launch preliminary armaments protocol.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes. Okay, okay, okay, okay. Dalek fleet, minimum twelvethousand battleships, armed to the teeth. Ah! But we've got surprise onour side. They'll never expect three people to attack twelve thousandDalek battleships. Because we'd be killed instantly. So it would be afairly short surprise. Forget surprise.<|endoftext|>
|0| Course correction proceeding.)<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, Cyberships.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, Dalek ships. Listen to them. Those are Dalek ships.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes. Dalek ships and Cyberships.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, we need to start a fight, turn them on each other. Imean, that's easy. It's the Daleks. They're so cross.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sontaran. Four battlefleets.<|endoftext|>
|1| Sontarans! Talk about cross, who stole all their handbags?<|endoftext|>
|0| Terileptil. Slitheen, Chelonian, Nestene, Drahvin. Sycorax,Haemogoth, Zygon, Atraxi, Draconian. They're all here for thePandorica.<|endoftext|>
|1| What are you? What could you possibly be?<|endoftext|>
|0| What do we do?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, listen to me. Everything that ever hated you is cominghere tonight. You can't win this. You can't even fight it. Doctor, thisonce, just this one time, please, you have to run.<|endoftext|>
|1| Run where?<|endoftext|>
|0| Fight how?<|endoftext|>
|1| The greatest military machine in the history of the universe.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is? The Daleks?<|endoftext|>
|1| No. No, no, no, no, no. The Romans.<|endoftext|>
|0| So. I return to my command after one week and discover we'vebeen playing host to Cleopatra. Who's in Egypt. And dead.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes. Funny how things work out.<|endoftext|>
|0| The sky is falling and you make jokes. Who are you?<|endoftext|>
|0| When you fight Barbarians, what must they think of you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, riddles now.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where do they think you come from?<|endoftext|>
|0| A place more deadly and more powerful and more impatientthan their tiny minds can imagine.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where do I come from? Your world has visitors. You're allBarbarians now.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is that? Tell me what?<|endoftext|>
|0| A fool would say the work of the Gods, but you've been a soldiertoo long to believe there are Gods watching over us. There is, however,a man. And tonight he's going to need your help.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sir?<|endoftext|>
|0| One moment.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, it seems you have a volunteer.<|endoftext|>
|0| So what's this got to do with the Tardis?<|endoftext|>
|1| Nothing, as far as I know.<|endoftext|>
|0| But Vincent's painting. The Tardis was exploding. Is that going tohappen?<|endoftext|>
|1| One problem at a time. There's forcefield technology insidethis box. If I can enhance the signal, I could extend it all overStonehenge. Could buy us half an hour.<|endoftext|>
|0| What good is half an hour?<|endoftext|>
|1| There are fruit flies live on Hoppledom Six that live fortwenty minutes and they don't even mate for life. There was going to bea point to that. I'll get back to you.<|endoftext|>
|0| So, are you proposing to someone?<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm sorry?<|endoftext|>
|0| I found this in your pocket.<|endoftext|>
|1| No. No, no, that's er, a memory. A friend of mine. Someone Ilost. Do you mind?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's weird. I feel, I don't know, something.<|endoftext|>
|1| People fall out of the world sometimes, but they always leavetraces. Little things we can't quite account for. Faces in photographs,luggage, half eaten meals, rings. Nothing is ever forgotten, notcompletely. And if something can be remembered, it can come back.<|endoftext|>
|0| So, was she nice, your friend?<|endoftext|>
|1| Remember that night you flew away with me?<|endoftext|>
|0| Of course I do.<|endoftext|>
|1| And you asked me why I was taking you and I told you therewasn't a reason. I was lying.<|endoftext|>
|0| What, so you did have a reason?<|endoftext|>
|1| Your house.<|endoftext|>
|0| My house.<|endoftext|>
|1| It was too big. Too many empty rooms. Does it ever bother you,Amy, that your life doesn't make any sense?<|endoftext|>
|0| What was that?<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay, I need a proper look. Got to draw its fire, give it atarget.<|endoftext|>
|0| How?<|endoftext|>
|1| You know how sometimes I have really brilliant ideas?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|1| Sorry.<|endoftext|>
|1| Look at me, I'm a target!<|endoftext|>
|0| What is that?<|endoftext|>
|1| Cyberarm. Arm of Cyberman.<|endoftext|>
|0| And what's a Cyberman?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, sort of part man, part robot. The organic part must havedied out years ago. Now the robot part is looking for, well, freshmeat.<|endoftext|>
|0| What, us?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's just like being an organ donor, except you're alive andsort of screaming. I need to get round behind it. Could you draw itsfire?<|endoftext|>
|0| What, like you did?<|endoftext|>
|1| You'll be fine if you're quick. It's only got one arm,literally.<|endoftext|>
|1| Come here!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|1| Scrambled its circuits, but stay where you are, it could bebluffing.<|endoftext|>
|0| Bluffing? It's an arm.<|endoftext|>
|1| I said stay where you are!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|0| You will be assimilated.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah? You and whose body?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor? Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|0| Who, who are you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello, Amy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Whoa, whoa, whoa.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sir, the man's coming round.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy? Where's Amy?<|endoftext|>
|0| She's fine, Doctor. Just unconscious.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay. Yes, she's sedated, that's all. Half an hour, she'll befine. Okay, Romans. Good. I was just wishing for Romans. Good oldRiver. How many?<|endoftext|>
|0| Fifty men up top, volunteers. What about that thing?<|endoftext|>
|1| Fifty? You're not exactly a legion.<|endoftext|>
|0| Your friend was very persuasive, but it's a tough sell.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, I know that, Rory. I'm not exactly one to miss theobvious. But we need everything we can get. Okay, Cyberweapons. This isbasically a sentry box, so headless wonder here was a sentry. Probablygot himself duffed up by the locals. Never underestimate a Celt.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|1| Hush, Rory. Thinking. Why leave a Cyberman on guard, unlessit's a Cyberthing in the box. But why would they lock up one of theirown? Okay, no, not a Cyberthing, but what? What? No, I'm missingsomething obvious, Rory. Something big. Something right slap in frontof me. I can feel it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, I think you probably are.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'll get it in a minute.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hello again.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello.<|endoftext|>
|1| How've you been?<|endoftext|>
|0| Good. Yeah. Good. I mean, Roman.<|endoftext|>
|1| Rory, I'm not trying to be rude, but you died.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, I know. I was there.<|endoftext|>
|1| You died and then you were erased from time. You didn't justdie, you were never born at all. You never existed.<|endoftext|>
|0| Erased? What does that mean?<|endoftext|>
|1| How can you be here?<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't know. It's kind of fuzzy.<|endoftext|>
|1| Fuzzy?<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, I died and turned into a Roman. It's very distracting. Didshe miss me?<|endoftext|>
|0| What is it? What's happening?<|endoftext|>
|1| The final phase. It's opening.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're surrounded. Have you got a plan?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes. Now hurry up and<|endoftext|>
|1| Get the Tardis here. I need equipment. Whatare you? They're all here, all of them, all for you. What could youpossibly be?<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry, sorry, dropped it. Hello,Stonehenge! Who takes the Pandorica, takes the universe. But bad news,everyone,<|endoftext|>
|1| Because guess who? Ha! Listen, you lot, you're all whizzingabout. It's really very distracting. Could you all just stay still aminute because I am talking! The question of the hour is, who's got thePandorica? Answer, I do. Next question. Who's coming to take it fromme? Come on! Look at me. No plan, no back up, no weapons worth a damn.Oh, and something else. I don't have anything to lose! So, if you'resitting up there in your silly little spaceship, with all your sillylittle guns, and you've got any plans on taking the Pandorica tonight,just remember who's standing in your way. Remember every black day Iever stopped you, and then, and then, do the smart thing. Let somebodyelse try first.<|endoftext|>
|1| That'll keep them squabbling for half an hour. Romans.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's the matter with you?<|endoftext|>
|0| They're still out there. What do we do now?<|endoftext|>
|1| If I can stop whatever's in this box getting out, then they'llgo home.<|endoftext|>
|0| Right.<|endoftext|>
|1| Rory, I'm sorry. You're going to have to be very brave now.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, my head.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ah.<|endoftext|>
|1| Just your basic knock-out drops. Get some fresh air, you'll befine.<|endoftext|>
|0| Is it safe up there?<|endoftext|>
|1| Not remotely, but it's fresh.<|endoftext|>
|0| Fine. Oh, you're the guy, yeah? The one who did the swordy thing.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, thanks for the swording. Nice swording.<|endoftext|>
|0| No problem. My men are up there. They'll look after you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Good. Love a Roman.<|endoftext|>
|0| She doesn't remember me. How can she not remember me?<|endoftext|>
|1| Because you never existed.<|endoftext|>
|0| What are you doing? What's wrong?<|endoftext|>
|1| There are cracks. Cracks in time. There'sgoing to be a huge explosion in the future, on one particular day. Andevery other moment in history is cracking around it.<|endoftext|>
|0| So how does that work? What kind of explosion? What exploded?<|endoftext|>
|0| And for those of us who can't read the base code of theuniverse?<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy's time.<|endoftext|>
|1| Doesn't matter. The cracks are everywhere now. Get too close tothem and you can fall right out of the universe.<|endoftext|>
|0| So I fell through a crack and now I was never born?<|endoftext|>
|1| Basically.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, how did I end up here?<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't know, you shouldn't have. What happened? From yourpoint of view, what physically happened?<|endoftext|>
|0| I was in the cave, with you and Amy. I was dying, and then I wasjust here, a Roman soldier. A proper Roman. Head full of Roman stuff. Awhole other life, just here like I'd woken up from a dream. I startedto think it was a dream, you and Amy and Leadworth. And then today, inthe camp, the men were talking about the visitors. The girl with thered hair. I thought you'd come back for me. But she can't even rememberme.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, shut up.<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|1| Go get her.<|endoftext|>
|0| But I don't understand. Why am I here?<|endoftext|>
|1| Because you are. The universe is big. It's vast and complicatedand ridiculous, and sometimes, very rarely, impossible things justhappen and we call them miracles, and that's the theory. Nine hundredyears, never seen one yet, but this would do me. Now get upstairs.She's Amy and she's surrounded by Romans. I'm not sure history can takeit.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay. You okay now?<|endoftext|>
|0| Silence will fall.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why have you brought me here?<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, so something's been here.<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy. Oh, Doctor, why do I let you out?<|endoftext|>
|0| A place more deadly and more powerful and moreimpatient than their tiny minds can imagine.<|endoftext|>
|0| So it's kind of like Pandora's box, then? That was myfavourite book when I was a kid.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh no.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you okay?<|endoftext|>
|0| Did the Doctor send you? I'm fine. He just fusses.<|endoftext|>
|0| You got a blanket. That's good. Who gave you that?<|endoftext|>
|0| One of the fellows.<|endoftext|>
|0| Which one?<|endoftext|>
|0| Just one of them. Does it matter?<|endoftext|>
|0| No. No. Forget him. It. Forget it.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's your name?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm Rory. What's wrong?<|endoftext|>
|0| Nothing. It's just not what you expect Romans to be called. What'sit short for? Roranicus?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah. You're crying.<|endoftext|>
|1| The Tardis, where is it? Hurry up.<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't raise your voice, don't look alarmed,just listen.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hey, what's wrong?<|endoftext|>
|0| Nothing. It's like, it's like I'm happy. Why am I happy?<|endoftext|>
|0| They're not real. They can't be. They're allright here in the story book. Those actual Romans. The ones I sent you,the ones you're with right now. They're all in a book in Amy's house. Achildren's picture book.<|endoftext|>
|1| What are you even doing there?<|endoftext|>
|0| It doesn't matter. The Tardis went wrong.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, how is this possible?<|endoftext|>
|1| Something's using her memories. Amy'smemories.<|endoftext|>
|0| But how?<|endoftext|>
|1| You said something had been there.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| There's burn marks on the grass outside.<|endoftext|>
|0| Landing patterns.<|endoftext|>
|1| If they've been to her house, they could have used her psychicresidue. Structures can hold memories, that's why houses have ghosts.They could've taken a snapshot of Amy's memories. But why?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, who are those Romans?<|endoftext|>
|1| Projections, or duplicates.<|endoftext|>
|0| But they were helping us. My lipstick evenworked.<|endoftext|>
|1| They might think they're real. The perfectdisguise. They actually believe their own cover story, right untilthey're activated.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, that Centurion.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's the matter?<|endoftext|>
|0| Nothing. I don't know why I'm doing that.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's me. Amy, please. It's me.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's a trap. It has to be. They used Amy toconstruct a scenario you'd believe, to get close to you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Why? Who'd do that? What for? It doesn'tmake sense.<|endoftext|>
|0| River? River?<|endoftext|>
|1| River, what's happening?<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't know. It's the engines. Doctor,there's something wrong with the Tardis, like something else iscontrolling it.<|endoftext|>
|1| You're flying it wrong.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm flying it perfectly. You taught me.<|endoftext|>
|1| Where are you? What's the date reading?<|endoftext|>
|1| You need to get out of there now. Any othertime zone.<|endoftext|>
|0| Just go.<|endoftext|>
|0| I can't break free.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, then shut down the Tardis. Shut downeverything!<|endoftext|>
|0| I can't!<|endoftext|>
|0| Silence will fall. Silence will fall.<|endoftext|>
|0| But I don't know you, I've never seen youbefore in my life.<|endoftext|>
|0| You have. You know you have. It's me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why am I crying?<|endoftext|>
|0| Because you remember me. I came back. You're crying because youremember me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Someone else is flying it. An externalforce. I've lost control.<|endoftext|>
|1| But how? Why?<|endoftext|>
|1| Listen to me, just land her anywhere. Emergency landing, now.There are cracks in time. I've seen them everywhere, and they'regetting wider. The Tardis exploding is what causes them, but we canstop the cracks ever happening if you just land her.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's not safe.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, now. Ready to come out, are we?<|endoftext|>
|0| Argh! No! No, please. No! I'm not going. I'mRory!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm down.<|endoftext|>
|0| I've landed.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, just walk out of the doors. If there's no oneinside, the Tardis engines shut down automatically.<|endoftext|>
|1| Just get out of there.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm going.<|endoftext|>
|1| Run!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor! Doctor, I can't open the doors!<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy!<|endoftext|>
|0| Listen to me. You have to run. You have toget as far away from here as you can. I'm a thing! I'll kill you. Justgo! Please, no, I don't want to go. I'm Rory! I'm, I'm<|endoftext|>
|0| Williams. Rory Williams from Leadworth. My boyfriend. How could Iever forget you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy, you've got to run. I can't hold on. I'm going.<|endoftext|>
|0| You are Rory Williams and you aren't going anywhere ever again.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, I can't open the doors! Doctor,please, I've got seconds!<|endoftext|>
|1| Plastic Romans. Duplicates, driven by theNestene Consciousness, eh? Deep cover, but what for? What are youdoing? What's in there, eh? What's coming out?<|endoftext|>
|0| The Pandorica is ready.<|endoftext|>
|1| What, do you mean it's open?<|endoftext|>
|0| You have been scanned, assessed, understood, Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| The ring. Remember the ring? You'd never letme wear it in case I lost it.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Doctor gave it to me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Show it to me. Show me the ring.<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Come on. Just show it to me.<|endoftext|>
|1| Scanned? Scanned by what, a box?<|endoftext|>
|0| Your limits and capacities have been extrapolated.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Pandorica is ready.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ready for what?<|endoftext|>
|0| Ready for you.<|endoftext|>
|0| There it is. You remember. This is you, andyou are staying.<|endoftext|>
|0| No.<|endoftext|>
|0| No! No! No!<|endoftext|>
|1| You lot, working together. An alliance. How is that possible?<|endoftext|>
|0| The cracks in the skin of the universe.<|endoftext|>
|0| All reality is threatened.<|endoftext|>
|0| All universes will be deleted.<|endoftext|>
|1| What? And you've come to me for help?<|endoftext|>
|0| No. We will save the universe from you!<|endoftext|>
|1| From me?<|endoftext|>
|0| All projections correlate. All evidence concurs. TheDoctor will destroy the universe.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, no, no. You've got it wrong.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Pandorica was constructed to ensure the safety of theAlliance.<|endoftext|>
|0| A scenario was devised from the memories of your companion.<|endoftext|>
|0| A trap the Doctor could not resist.<|endoftext|>
|0| The cracks in time are the work of the Doctor. It is confirmed.<|endoftext|>
|1| No. no, no, not me, the Tardis. And I'm not in the Tardis, amI?<|endoftext|>
|0| Only the Doctor can pilot the Tardis.<|endoftext|>
|1| Please, listen to me!<|endoftext|>
|0| You will be prevented.<|endoftext|>
|1| Total event collapse! Every sun will supernova at every momentin history. The whole universe will never have existed. Please, listento me!<|endoftext|>
|0| Seal the Pandorica.<|endoftext|>
|1| No! Please, listen to me! The Tardis is exploding right now andI'm the only one who can stop it! Listen to me!<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm sorry, my love.<|endoftext|>
|0| Dear Santa. Thank you for the dolls and pencils and the fish.It's Easter now, so I hope I don't wake you, but, honest, it is anemergency. There's a crack in my wall. Aunt Sharon says it's just anordinary crack, but I know it's not, because at night there's voices.So, please, please, could you send someone to fix it, or a policeman,or<|endoftext|>
|0| Back in a moment.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's a lovely painting, Amelia. And what are all these?<|endoftext|>
|0| Stars.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, Amelia.<|endoftext|>
|0| Tell you what, shall we go outside?<|endoftext|>
|0| What do you see, Amelia?<|endoftext|>
|0| The moon.<|endoftext|>
|0| And what else?<|endoftext|>
|0| Just the dark.<|endoftext|>
|0| But no stars. If there were stars up there, we'd be able tosee them, wouldn't we? Amelia, look at me. You know this is all just astory, don't you? You know there's no such thing as stars.<|endoftext|>
|0| But there's bound to be a bit of her that feels alone.Amelia's a really good person.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's quite common, actually.Throughout history, people have talked about seeing stars in the sky.God knows where it comes from.<|endoftext|>
|0| I just don't want her growing up and joining one of thoseStar Cults. I don't trust that Richard Dawkins.<|endoftext|>
|0| Come on, Aunt Sharon.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, look at that. That's good, isn't it?<|endoftext|>
|0| Not that. This way.<|endoftext|>
|0| This way!<|endoftext|>
|0| Amelia!<|endoftext|>
|0| Amelia!<|endoftext|>
|0| Amelia? Amelia?<|endoftext|>
|0| Amelia Pond, please go to the reception, please. Your aunt iswaiting for you there. Amelia Pond, please go to reception.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, kid. This is where it gets complicated.<|endoftext|>
|0| So the universe ended. You missed that, in 102 AD. I suppose thismeans you and I never get born at all. Twice, in my case. You wouldhave laughed at that. Please laugh. The Doctor said the universe washuge and ridiculous, and sometimes there were miracles. I could do witha ridiculous miracle about now.<|endoftext|>
|1| Rory! Listen, she's not dead. Well, she is dead, but it's notthe end of the world. Well, it is the end of the world. Actually, it'sthe end of the universe. Oh, no. Hang on.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor? Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|1| You need to get me out of the Pandorica.<|endoftext|>
|0| But you're not in the Pandorica.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, I am. Well, I'm not now, but I was back then. Well, backnow from your point of view, which is back then from my point of view.Time travel, you can't keep it straight in your head. It's easy to openfrom the outside. Just point and press.<|endoftext|>
|1| Now go.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, and when you're done, leave my screwdriver in her toppocket. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
|0| What do you mean? Done what?<|endoftext|>
|1| How did you do that?<|endoftext|>
|0| You gave me this.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, I didn't.<|endoftext|>
|0| You did. Look at it.<|endoftext|>
|1| Temporal energy. Same screwdriver at different points in itsown time stream. Which means it was me who gave it to you. Me from thefuture. I've got a future. That's nice. That's not.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah. What are they?<|endoftext|>
|1| History has collapsed. Whole races have been deleted fromexistence. These are just like after-images. Echoes. Fossils in time.The footprints of the never-were.<|endoftext|>
|0| Er, what does that mean?<|endoftext|>
|1| Total event collapse. The universe literally never happened.<|endoftext|>
|0| So, how can we be here? What's keeping us safe?<|endoftext|>
|1| Nothing. Eye of the storm, that's all. We're just the lastlight to go out. Amy. Where's Amy?<|endoftext|>
|0| I killed her.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, Rory.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, what am I?<|endoftext|>
|1| You're a Nestene duplicate. A lump of plastic with delusions ofhumanity.<|endoftext|>
|0| But I'm Rory now. Whatever was happening, it's stopped. I'm Rory.<|endoftext|>
|1| That's software talking.<|endoftext|>
|0| Can you help her? Is there anything you can do?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, probably, if I had the time.<|endoftext|>
|0| The time?<|endoftext|>
|1| All of creation has just been wiped from the sky. Do you knowhow many lives now never happened? All the people who never lived? Yourgirlfriend isn't more important than the whole universe.<|endoftext|>
|0| She is to me!<|endoftext|>
|1| Welcome back, Rory Williams! Sorry. Had to be sure. Hell of agun-arm you're packing there. Right, we need to get her downstairs. Andtake that look off your plastic face. You're getting married in themorning.<|endoftext|>
|0| So you've got a plan, then?<|endoftext|>
|1| Bit of a plan, yeah. Memories are more powerful than you think,and Amy Pond is not an ordinary girl. Grew up with a time crack in herwall. The universe pouring through her dreams every night. The Nestenestook a memory print of her and got a bit more than they bargained for,like you. Not just your face, but your heart and your soul.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm leaving her a message for when she wakes up, so she knowswhat's happening.<|endoftext|>
|0| Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you doing?<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm saving her. This box is the ultimate prison. You can't evenescape by dying. It forces you to stay alive.<|endoftext|>
|0| But she's already dead.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, she's mostly dead. The Pandorica can stasis-lock her thatway. Now, all it needs is a scan of her living DNA and it'll restoreher.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where's it going to get that?<|endoftext|>
|1| In about two thousand years.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you all right? Who are you?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm fine. I'm supposed to rest. Got to rest, the Doctor says.<|endoftext|>
|0| What doctor?<|endoftext|>
|1| He's in here. Left a message in my head like I'm ananswerphone. Where am I? Hang on. National Museum, right? I was hereonce when I was a little<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, complicated. Let's see, it's what, 1996?<|endoftext|>
|0| Who are you?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's a long story. Oh. A very long story.<|endoftext|>
|0| She's going to be in that box for two thousand years?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, but we're taking a shortcut. River's vortex manipulator.Rubbish way to time travel, but the universe is tiny now. We'll befine.<|endoftext|>
|0| So hang on. The future's still there, then. Our world.<|endoftext|>
|1| A version of it. Not quite the one you know. Earth alone in thesky. Let's go and have a look. You put your hand there. Don't worry.Should be safe.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's not what I'm worried about.<|endoftext|>
|1| She'll be fine. Nothing can get into this box.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, you got in there.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, there's only one of me. I counted.<|endoftext|>
|0| This box needs a guard. I killed the last one.<|endoftext|>
|1| No. Rory, no. Don't even think about it.<|endoftext|>
|0| She'll be all alone.<|endoftext|>
|1| She won't feel it.<|endoftext|>
|0| You bet she won't.<|endoftext|>
|1| Two thousand years, Rory. You won't even sleep. you'd beconscious every second. It would drive you mad.<|endoftext|>
|0| Will she be safer if I stay? Look me in the eye and tell me shewouldn't be safer.<|endoftext|>
|1| Rory, you<|endoftext|>
|0| Answer me!<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes. Obviously.<|endoftext|>
|0| Then how could I leave her?<|endoftext|>
|1| Why do you have to be so human?<|endoftext|>
|0| Because right now, I'm not.<|endoftext|>
|1| Listen to me. This is the last bit of advice you're going toget in a very long time. You're living plastic, but you're notimmortal. I have no idea how long you'll last. And you're notindestructible. Stay away from heat and radio signals when they comealong. You can't heal, or repair yourself. Any damage is permanent. So,for God's sake, however bored you get, stay out of<|endoftext|>
|0| According to legend, wherever the Pandorica was taken,throughout its long history, the Centurion would be there, guarding it.<|endoftext|>
|0| He appears as an iconic image in the artwork of manycultures, and there are several documented accounts of his appearances,and his warnings to the many who attempted to open the box before itstime. His last recorded appearance was during the London blitz in 1941.The warehouse where the Pandorica was stored was destroyed byincendiary bombs, but the box itself was found the next morning, a safedistance from the blaze. There are eyewitness accounts from the nightof the fire of a figure in Roman dress, carrying the box from theflames. Since then, there have been no sightings of the Lone Centurion,and many have speculated that if he ever existed, he perished in thefires of that night, performing one last act of devotion to the box hehad pledged to protect for nearly two thousand years.<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory. Oh, Rory.<|endoftext|>
|0| Exterminate!<|endoftext|>
|0| What's that?<|endoftext|>
|0| Exterminate!<|endoftext|>
|1| Trouble. Oh. Ah, two of you. Complicated.<|endoftext|>
|0| Exterminate! Weapons systems restoring.<|endoftext|>
|1| Come along, Ponds.<|endoftext|>
|0| Exterminate!<|endoftext|>
|0| What are we doing?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, we are running into a dead end, where I'll have abrilliant plan, that basically involves not being in one.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's going on?<|endoftext|>
|1| Get out of here. Go! Just run!<|endoftext|>
|0| Drop the device!<|endoftext|>
|1| It's not a weapon. Scan it. It's not a weapon, and you don'thave the power to waste.<|endoftext|>
|0| Scans indicate intruder unarmed.<|endoftext|>
|0| Do you think?<|endoftext|>
|0| Vision impaired! Vision<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy!<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I couldn't help it. It just happened.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, Shut up.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, shut up, because we've got to go. Come on.<|endoftext|>
|0| I waited. Two thousand years I waited for you.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, still shut up.<|endoftext|>
|1| And break. And breathe. Well, somebody didn't get out much fortwo thousand years.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm thirsty. Can I get a drink?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, it's all mouths today, isn't it. The light. The light fromthe Pandorica, it must have hit the Dalek.<|endoftext|>
|1| Out! Out! Out!<|endoftext|>
|1| So, two thousand years. How did you do?<|endoftext|>
|0| Kept out of trouble.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh. How?<|endoftext|>
|0| Unsuccessfully. The mop! That's how you looked all those yearsago when you gave me the sonic.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah. Well, no time to lose, then.<|endoftext|>
|1| Rory! Listen, she's not dead. Well, she isdead, but it's not the end of the world.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oops, sorry.<|endoftext|>
|0| How can he do that? Is he magic?<|endoftext|>
|1| You need to get me out of the Pandorica.<|endoftext|>
|0| But you're not in the Pandorica.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, I am. Well, I'm not now, but I was back then.<|endoftext|>
|1| Right, let's go then. Wait! Now I don'thave the sonic. I just gave it Rory two thousand years ago.<|endoftext|>
|1| And when you're done, leave my screwdriverin her top pocket.<|endoftext|>
|1| Right then.<|endoftext|>
|1| Off we go! No, hang on. How did you know to come here?<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah, my handwriting. Okay.<|endoftext|>
|1| There you go. Drink up.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is that? How are you doing that?<|endoftext|>
|1| Vortex manipulator. Cheap and nasty time travel. Very bad foryou. I'm trying to give it up.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where are we going?<|endoftext|>
|1| The roof.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, it's you. How can it be you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, is that you?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, it's me. Me from the future.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you? I mean, is he, is he dead?<|endoftext|>
|1| What? Dead? Yes, yes. Of course he's dead. Right, I've gottwelve minutes. That's good.<|endoftext|>
|0| Twelve minutes to live? How is that good?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, you can do loads in twelve minutes. Suck a mint, buy asledge, have a fast bath. Come on, the roof.<|endoftext|>
|0| We can't leave you here dead.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, good. Are you in charge now? So tell me, what are we goingto do about Amelia?<|endoftext|>
|0| Where did she go?<|endoftext|>
|0| Amelia?<|endoftext|>
|1| There is no Amelia. From now on, there never was. History isstill collapsing.<|endoftext|>
|0| But how can I still be here if she's not?<|endoftext|>
|1| You're an anomaly. We all are. We're all just hanging on at theeye of the storm. But the eye is closing, and if we don't do somethingfast, reality will never have happened. Today, just dying is a result.Now, come on!<|endoftext|>
|0| He won't die. Time can be rewritten. He'll find a way. I know hewill.<|endoftext|>
|0| Move it! Come on!<|endoftext|>
|0| Restore. Restore!<|endoftext|>
|1| History is shrinking. Is anybody listening to me? The universeis collapsing. We don't have much time left.<|endoftext|>
|0| What are you doing?<|endoftext|>
|1| Looking for the Tardis.<|endoftext|>
|0| But the Tardis exploded.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay then, I'm looking for an exploding Tardis.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't understand. So, the Tardis blew up and took the universewith it. But why would it do that? How?<|endoftext|>
|1| Good question for another day. The question for now is, totalevent collapse means that every star in the universe never happened.Not one single one of them ever shone. So, if all the stars that everwere are gone, then what is that?<|endoftext|>
|1| Like I said, I'm looking for an exploding Tardis.<|endoftext|>
|0| But that's the sun.<|endoftext|>
|1| Is it? Well, here's the noise that sun is making right now.<|endoftext|>
|1| That's my Tardis burning up. That's what's been keeping theEarth warm.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, there's something else.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm sorry, my love.<|endoftext|>
|0| There's a voice.<|endoftext|>
|0| I can't hear anything.<|endoftext|>
|0| Trust the plastic.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm sorry, my love. I'm sorry, my love. I'm sorry, my love.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, that's River. How can she be up there?<|endoftext|>
|0| It must be like a recording or something.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, it's not. Of course, the emergency protocols. The Tardishas sealed off the control room and put her into a time loop to saveher. She is right at the heart of the explosion.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm sorry, my love. I'm sorry, my love. I'm sorry, my love.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm sorry, my love.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hi, honey. I'm home.<|endoftext|>
|0| And what sort of time do you call this?<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy! And the plastic Centurion?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's okay, he's on our side.<|endoftext|>
|0| Really?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah.<|endoftext|>
|0| I dated a Nestene duplicate once. Swappable head. It did keepthings fresh. Right then, I have questions, but number one is this.What in the name of sanity have you got on your head?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh!<|endoftext|>
|0| Exterminate!<|endoftext|>
|1| Run, run! Move, move. Go!<|endoftext|>
|0| Come on!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, come on.<|endoftext|>
|1| Shush. It's moving away, finding another way in. It needs torestore its power before it can attack again. Now, that means we've gotexactly four and a half minutes before it's at lethal capacity.<|endoftext|>
|0| How do you know?<|endoftext|>
|1| Because that's when it's due to kill me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Kill you? What do you mean, kill you?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, shut up. Never mind. How can that Dalek even exist? It waserased from time and then it came back.<|endoftext|>
|1| How?<|endoftext|>
|0| You said the light from the Pandorica<|endoftext|>
|1| It's not a light, it's a restoration field. But never mind,call it a light. That light brought Amy back, restored her, but howcould it bring back a Dalek when the Daleks have never existed?<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, tell us.<|endoftext|>
|1| When the Tardis blew up, it caused a total event collapse. Atime explosion. And that explosion blasted every atom in every momentof the universe. Except<|endoftext|>
|0| Except inside the Pandorica.<|endoftext|>
|1| The perfect prison. And inside it, perfectly preserved, a fewbillion atoms of the universe as it was. In theory, you couldextrapolate the whole universe from a single one of them, like, likecloning a body from a single cell. And we've got the bumper familypack.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, no. Too fast. I'm not getting it.<|endoftext|>
|1| The box contains a memory of the universe, and the lighttransmits the memory, and that's how we're going to do it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Do what?<|endoftext|>
|1| Relight the fire. Reboot the universe. Come on!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, you're being completely ridiculous. The Pandoricapartially restored one Dalek. If it can't even reboot a single lifeform properly, how's it reboot the whole of reality?<|endoftext|>
|1| What if we give it a moment of infinite power? What if we cantransmit the light from the Pandorica to every particle of space andtime simultaneously?<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, that would be lovely, dear, but we can't, because it'scompletely impossible.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah no, you see, it's not. It's almost completely impossible.One spark is all we need.<|endoftext|>
|0| For what?<|endoftext|>
|1| Big Bang Two! Now listen.<|endoftext|>
|0| Exterminate! Exterminate!<|endoftext|>
|0| Get back. River, get back now!<|endoftext|>
|0| Exterminate!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor? Doctor, it's me, River. Can you hear me? What is it?What do you need?<|endoftext|>
|0| Where did he go? Damn it, he could be anywhere.<|endoftext|>
|0| He went downstairs, twelve minutes ago.<|endoftext|>
|0| Show me!<|endoftext|>
|0| River, he died.<|endoftext|>
|0| Systems restoring. You will be exterminated.<|endoftext|>
|0| We've got to move. That thing's coming back to life.<|endoftext|>
|0| You go to the Doctor. I'll be right with you.<|endoftext|>
|0| You will be exterminated!<|endoftext|>
|0| Not yet. Your systems are still restoring, which means yourshield density is compromised. One Alpha Mezon burst through youreyestalk would kill you stone dead.<|endoftext|>
|0| Records indicate you will show mercy. You are an associate ofthe Doctor's.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm River Song. Check your records again.<|endoftext|>
|0| Mercy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Say it again.<|endoftext|>
|0| Mercy!<|endoftext|>
|0| One more time.<|endoftext|>
|0| Mercy!<|endoftext|>
|0| How could he have moved? He was dead. Doctor? Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|0| But he was dead.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who told you that?<|endoftext|>
|0| He did.<|endoftext|>
|0| Rule one. The Doctor lies.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where's the Dalek?<|endoftext|>
|0| It died.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|0| Why did he tell us he was dead?<|endoftext|>
|0| We were a diversion. As long as the Dalek was chasing us, he couldwork down here.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, can you hear me? What were you doing?<|endoftext|>
|0| What's happening?<|endoftext|>
|0| Reality's collapsing. It's speeding up. Look at this room.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where'd everything go?<|endoftext|>
|0| History's being erased. Time's running out. Doctor, what wereyou doing? Tell us. Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|1| (sotto) Big Bang Two.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Big Bang. That's the beginning of the universe, right?<|endoftext|>
|0| What, and Big Bang Two is the bang that brings us back? Is thatwhat you mean?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh.<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|0| The Tardis is still burning. It's exploding at every point inhistory. If you threw the Pandorica into the explosion, right into theheart of the fire.<|endoftext|>
|0| Then what?<|endoftext|>
|0| Then let there be light. The light from the Pandorica wouldexplode everywhere at once, just like he said.<|endoftext|>
|0| That would work? That would bring everything back?<|endoftext|>
|0| A restoration field powered by an exploding Tardis, happening atevery moment in history. Oh, that's brilliant. It might even work. He'swired the vortex manipulator to the rest of the box.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why?<|endoftext|>
|0| So he can take it with him. He's going to fly the Pandorica intothe heart of the explosion.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you okay?<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you?<|endoftext|>
|0| No.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, shut up then!<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy, he wants to talk to you.<|endoftext|>
|0| So, what happens here? Big Bang Two? What happens to us?<|endoftext|>
|0| We all wake up where we ought to be. None of this ever happensand we don't remember it.<|endoftext|>
|0| River, tell me he comes back, too.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Doctor will be the heart of the explosion.<|endoftext|>
|0| So?<|endoftext|>
|0| So all the cracks in time will close, but he'll be on the wrongside, trapped in the never-space, the void between the worlds. Allmemory of him will be purged from the universe. He will never have beenborn. Now, please. He wants to talk to you before he goes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Not to you?<|endoftext|>
|0| He doesn't really know me yet. Now he never will.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hi.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy Pond. The girl who waited all night in your garden. Was itworth it?<|endoftext|>
|0| Shut up. Of course it was.<|endoftext|>
|1| You asked me why I was taking you with me and I said, noreason. I was lying.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's not important.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, it's the most important thing left in the universe. It'swhy I'm doing this. Amy, your house was too big. That big, empty house,and just you.<|endoftext|>
|0| And Aunt Sharon.<|endoftext|>
|1| Where were your mum and dad? Where was everybody who lived inthat big house?<|endoftext|>
|0| I lost my Mum and Dad.<|endoftext|>
|1| How? What happened to them? Where did they go?<|endoftext|>
|0| I, I don't<|endoftext|>
|1| It's okay, it's okay. Don't panic, it's not your fault.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't even remember.<|endoftext|>
|1| There was a crack in time in the wall of your bedroom, and it'sbeen eating away at your life for a long time now. Amy Pond, all alone.The girl who didn't make sense. How could I resist?<|endoftext|>
|0| How could I just forget?<|endoftext|>
|1| Nothing is ever forgotten. Not really. But you have to try.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor! It's speeding up!<|endoftext|>
|1| There's going to be a very big bang. Big Bang Two. Try andremember your family and they'll be there.<|endoftext|>
|0| How can I remember them if they never existed?<|endoftext|>
|1| Because you're special. That crack in your wall, all that time,the universe pouring into your head. You brought Rory back. You canbring them back, too. You just remember and they'll be there.<|endoftext|>
|0| You won't.<|endoftext|>
|1| You'll have your family back. You won't need your imaginaryfriend any more. Ha! Amy Pond crying over me, eh? Guess what?<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|1| Gotcha.<|endoftext|>
|0| Back! Get back!<|endoftext|>
|0| It's from the Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| What does it say?<|endoftext|>
|0| Geronimo.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh! Okay. I escaped, then. Brilliant. I love it when I do that.Legs, yes. Bow tie, cool. I can buy a fez.<|endoftext|>
|0| Lyle beach. The beach is the best. Automatic sand.<|endoftext|>
|0| Automatic sand? What does that mean?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's automated. Totally.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh.<|endoftext|>
|0| Cleans up the lolly sticks all by itself.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, hang on. That's last week when we went to Space Florida.I'm rewinding. My, my time stream unravelling, erasing. Closing.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hello, universe. Goodbye, Doctor. Amy. Amy.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah, three weeks ago, when she put the cardin the window. Amy! I need to tell you something. She can hear me. Butif she can hear me<|endoftext|>
|0| Good luck, everyone. Behave. Do not letthat girl open her eyes. Amy, later. River, going to need yourcomputer.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy, you need to start trusting me. It's never been moreimportant.<|endoftext|>
|0| But you don't always tell me the truth.<|endoftext|>
|1| If I always told you the truth, I wouldn't need you to trustme.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, the crack in my wall. How can it be here?<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't know yet but I'm working it out. Now, listen. Rememberwhat I told you when you were seven?<|endoftext|>
|0| What did you tell me?<|endoftext|>
|1| No. No, that's not the point. You have to remember.<|endoftext|>
|0| Remember what? Doctor? Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|1| Amelia's house. When she was seven. The night she waited.<|endoftext|>
|1| The girl who waited. Come here, you.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's funny. I thought if you could hear me, I could hang onsomehow. Silly me. Silly old Doctor. When you wake up, you'll have amum and dad, and you won't even remember me. Well, you'll remember me alittle. I'll be a story in your head. But that's okay. We're allstories in the end. Just make it a good one, eh? Because it was, youknow. It was the best. The daft old man who stole a magic box and ranaway. Did I ever tell you that I stole it? Well, I borrowed it. I wasalways going to take it back. Oh, that box. Amy, you'll dream aboutthat box. It'll never leave you. Big and little at the same time. Brandnew and ancient, and the bluest blue ever. And the times we had, eh?Would have had. Never had. In your dreams, they'll still be there. TheDoctor and Amy Pond, and the days that never came. The cracks areclosing. But they can't close properly until I'm on the other side. Idon't belong here any more. I think I'll skip the rest of the rewind. Ihate repeats. Live well. Love Rory. Bye bye, Pond.<|endoftext|>
|0| Morning!<|endoftext|>
|0| You're my mum. Oh, my God. You're my mum.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, of course I'm your mum. What's the matter with you? Andthis is your breakfast, which your father made, so feel free to tip itout of the window if it's an atrocity. Downstairs, ten minutes? Bigday!<|endoftext|>
|0| Of course she's my mum. Why is that surprising?<|endoftext|>
|0| Ah, Amelia. I fear I may have been usingthe same joke book as the best man.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're my tiny little dad!<|endoftext|>
|0| Amelia, why are you behaving as if you've never seen usbefore?<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't know. It's just.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello!<|endoftext|>
|0| Do you feel like you've forgotten something really important?<|endoftext|>
|0| Do you feel like there's a great big thing inyour head, and you feel like you should remember it, but you can't?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yep.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you just saying yes because you're scaredof me?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yep.<|endoftext|>
|0| I love you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yep.<|endoftext|>
|0| Er, I mean, I love you too!<|endoftext|>
|0| Ladies and gentlemen, ladiesand gentlemen, the father of the bride, Augustus Pond!<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry, everyone. I'll be another two minutes. I'm justreviewing certain aspects.<|endoftext|>
|0| Your father, Amelia, will be the absolute death of me. Unless,of course, I strike pre-emptively.<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy? You okay?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, I'm fine.<|endoftext|>
|0| Right. Er, you're crying.<|endoftext|>
|0| So I am. Why am I doing that?<|endoftext|>
|0| Because you're happy, probably. Happy Mrs Rory. Happy, happy,happy.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, I'm sad. I'm really, really sad.<|endoftext|>
|0| Great.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why am I sad? What's that?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, er, someone left it for you. A woman.<|endoftext|>
|0| But what is it?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's a book.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's blank.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's a present.<|endoftext|>
|0| But why?<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, you know the old saying. The old wedding thing. Huh? Amy,what? Hey.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ready now. Sorry about that. Last minute adjustments tocertain aspects. Now then, it hardly seems a year since<|endoftext|>
|0| At the age of six and announced that the new head teacherwasn't real because she looked like a cartoon.<|endoftext|>
|0| Shut up, Dad!<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy?<|endoftext|>
|0| Amelia?<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry, but shut up, please. There's someone missing. Someoneimportant. Someone so, so important.<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy, what's wrong?<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry. Sorry, everyone. But when I was a kid, I had an imaginaryfriend.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh no, not this again.<|endoftext|>
|0| The raggedy Doctor. My raggedy Doctor. But he wasn't imaginary, hewas real.<|endoftext|>
|0| The psychiatrists we sent her to.<|endoftext|>
|0| I remember you. I remember! I brought the others back, I can bringyou home, too. Raggedy man, I remember you, and you are late for mywedding!<|endoftext|>
|0| I found you. I found you in words, like you knew I would. That'swhy you told me the story the brand new, ancient blue box.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, clever. Very clever.<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy, what is it?<|endoftext|>
|0| Something old. Something new. Something borrowed. Something blue.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's the Doctor. How did we forget the Doctor? I was plastic. Hewas the stripper at my stag. Long story.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, Doctor. Did I surprise you this time?<|endoftext|>
|1| Er, yeah. Completely astonished. Never expected that. How luckyI happened to be wearing this old thing. Hello, everyone. I'm Amy'simaginary friend. But I came anyway.<|endoftext|>
|0| You absolutely, definitely may kiss the bride.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amelia, from now on I shall be leaving the kissing duties tothe brand new Mister Pond.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, I'm not Mister Pond. That's not how it works.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, it is.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, it is.<|endoftext|>
|1| Right then, everyone. I'll move my box. You're going to needthe space. I only came for the dancing.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're terrible. That is embarrassing!<|endoftext|>
|1| That's it. That's good. Keep it loose.<|endoftext|>
|1| Two thousand years. The boy who waited. Good on you, mate.<|endoftext|>
|0| Did you dance? Well, you always dance at weddings, don't you?<|endoftext|>
|1| You tell me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Spoilers.<|endoftext|>
|1| The writing's all back, but I didn't peek.<|endoftext|>
|0| Thank you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Are you married, River?<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you asking?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, hang on. Did you think I was asking you to marry me, or oror asking if you were married?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, but was that yes, or yes?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|1| River, who are you?<|endoftext|>
|0| You're going to find out very soon now. And I'm sorry, butthat's when everything changes.<|endoftext|>
|1| Nah.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oi! Where are you off to? We haven't even hada snog in the shrubbery yet.<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy!<|endoftext|>
|0| Shut up. It's my wedding.<|endoftext|>
|1| Sorry, you two. Shouldn't have slipped away. Bit busy, youknow?<|endoftext|>
|1| Space and time isn't safe yet. The Tardis exploded for areason. Something drew the Tardis to this particular date, and blew itup. Why? And why now?<|endoftext|>
|1| The Silence, whatever it is, is still out there, and I have to.Excuse me a moment.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hello? Oh, hello. I'm sorry, this is a very bad line. No, no,no, but that's not possible. She was sealed into the seventh Obelisk. Iwas at the prayer meeting. Well, no, I get that it's important. AnEgyptian goddess loose on the Orient Express, in space. Give us a mo.(to Amy and Rory) Sorry, something's come up. This will have to begoodbye.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, I think it's goodbye. Do you think it's goodbye?<|endoftext|>
|0| Definitely goodbye.<|endoftext|>
|0| Goodbye! Goodbye.<|endoftext|>
|1| Don't worry about a thing, your Majesty. We're on our way.<|endoftext|>
|0| Would all passengers please return to their seats and fastentheir safety belts? We are experiencing slight turbulence.<|endoftext|>
|0| Both engines failed, and the storm-gate's critical. The shipis going down. Christmas is cancelled.<|endoftext|>
|0| Entering atmosphere now. Level. Keep her level.<|endoftext|>
|0| Level with what? I can't see. What is that stuff?<|endoftext|>
|0| Clouds?<|endoftext|>
|0| What kind of clouds?<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you sending a distress signal?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's not me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who's in the honeymoon suite?<|endoftext|>
|0| I've sent for help.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who the hell are you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Look, there's a friend of mine, okay? And he can help us. He'llcome.<|endoftext|>
|0| And what are you wearing?<|endoftext|>
|0| That doesn't matter.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you from the honeymoon suite?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, shut up.<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy, the light's stopped flashing Does that mean he's coming?<|endoftext|>
|0| Honeymoon suite?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh. Oh, the clothes. Er. It is just a bit of fun.<|endoftext|>
|0| Really, shut up.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sensor loss on eighty percent of the hull.<|endoftext|>
|0| So, does this mean he's coming, or does it mean I need to changethe bulb?<|endoftext|>
|0| He'll come. He always comes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Right. Well, he is cutting it kind of fine.<|endoftext|>
|0| If we can't stabilise the orbit, we're finished.<|endoftext|>
|0| There's nothing to lock onto. I am flying blind.<|endoftext|>
|0| Come on, Doctor, come on.<|endoftext|>
|0| There's something coming alongside us. Something small, likea shuttle.<|endoftext|>
|0| Just this once, don't be late.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ma'am. Incoming message. It's from the other ship.<|endoftext|>
|0| On screen.<|endoftext|>
|0| What does that mean?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's Christmas.<|endoftext|>
|0| [OC]<|endoftext|>
|0| You know what I call it? I call it expecting something fornothing.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sir. Mister Sardick. We're only asking for one day. Just lether out for Christmas. She loves Christmas.<|endoftext|>
|0| Does she? Oh, does she? I see. Hello. Wakey, wakey. It'sChristmas. Do you know what? I think she's a bit cool about the wholething. Ha, ha! That was funny.<|endoftext|>
|0| She's frozen.<|endoftext|>
|0| She's what, sorry?<|endoftext|>
|0| She's in the ice. She can't hear you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, what a clever little boy. You must be so irritated. Howmuch?<|endoftext|>
|0| Er, it's four thousand five hundred Gideons, sir.<|endoftext|>
|0| You took a loan of four thousand five hundred Gideons, andLittle Miss Christmas is my security.<|endoftext|>
|0| We're not asking for her back. Just let her have one day. Lether have Christmas with us.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sir, it's the President.<|endoftext|>
|0| Tell him I'm busy. Now, where were we? Oh, yes. She's pretty,though, your daughter. Maybe I should keep her.<|endoftext|>
|0| She's not my daughter, sir.<|endoftext|>
|0| She's my sister. She volunteered for the ice when the familywere in difficulties many years ago.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry, sir. The President says there's a galaxy class shiptrapped in the cloud layer and, well, we have to let it land.<|endoftext|>
|0| Or?<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, or it'll crash, sir.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh. Well, it's a kind of landing, isn't it?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's from Earth, sir, registering over four thousand lifeformson board.<|endoftext|>
|0| Not if we wait a bit.<|endoftext|>
|0| You can't just let it crash, sir.<|endoftext|>
|0| Says who? Oh, give it here.<|endoftext|>
|0| Look, petal, we already have a surplus population. No morepeople allowed on this planet. I don't make the rules.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh no, hang on, I do.<|endoftext|>
|0| Right, you lot. Poor, begging people. Off home and pray for amiracle.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah. Yes. Blimey. Sorry. Christmas Eve on a rooftop. Saw achimney, my whole brain just went, what the hell.<|endoftext|>
|1| Don't worry, fat fellow will be doing the rounds later. I'mjust scoping out the general chimney-ness. Yes. Nice size, goodtraction. Big tick.<|endoftext|>
|0| Fat fellow?<|endoftext|>
|1| Father Christmas, Santa Claus or, as I've always known him,Jeff.<|endoftext|>
|0| There's no such person as Father Christmas.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, yeah?<|endoftext|>
|1| Me and Father Christmas, Frank Sinatra's hunting lodge, 1952.See him at the back with the blonde? Albert Einstein. The three of ustogether. Brrm. Watch out. Okay? Keep the faith. Stay off the naughtylist.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ooo. Now, what's this then? I love this. A big flashy lightything. That's what brought me here. Big flashy lighty things have gotme written all over them. Not actually, but give me time, and a crayon.Now, this big flashy lighty thing is connected to the spire in yourdome, yeah? And it controls the sky. Well, technically it controls theclouds, which technically aren't clouds at all. Well, they're clouds oftiny particles of ice. Ice clouds. Love that. Who's she?<|endoftext|>
|0| Nobody important.<|endoftext|>
|1| Nobody important. Blimey, that's amazing. Do you know, in ninehundred years of time and space, I've never met anyone who wasn'timportant before. Now, this console is the key to saving that ship, orI'll eat my hat. If I had a hat. I'll eat someone's hat. Not someonewho's using their hat. I don't want to shock a nun, or something.Sorry, rambling, because, because this isn't working!<|endoftext|>
|0| The controls are isomorphic. One to one. They respond only tome.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, you fibber. Isomorphic. There's no such thing.<|endoftext|>
|1| These controls are isomorphic.<|endoftext|>
|0| The skies of this entire world are mine. My family tamed them,and now I own them.<|endoftext|>
|1| Tamed the sky? What does that mean?<|endoftext|>
|0| It means I'm Kazran Sardick. How can you possibly not know whoI am?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, just easily bored, I suppose. So, I need your help, then.<|endoftext|>
|0| Make an appointment.<|endoftext|>
|1| There are four thousand and three people in a spaceship trappedin your cloud belt. Without your help, they're going to die.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|1| You don't have to let that happen.<|endoftext|>
|0| I know, but I'm going to. Bye, bye. Bored now. Chuck.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ooo, look at you, looking all tough now.<|endoftext|>
|1| There are four thousand and three people I won't allow to dietonight. Do you know where that puts you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Where?<|endoftext|>
|1| Four thousand and four.<|endoftext|>
|0| Was that a sort of threat-y thing?<|endoftext|>
|1| Whatever happens tonight, remember you brought it on yourself.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, yeah, right. Get him out of here. And next time, try andfind me some funny poor people.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, stop, don't.<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't you dare. You leave him.<|endoftext|>
|0| Get him out of here. Get that foul-smelling family out ofhere. Out!<|endoftext|>
|0| We're going!<|endoftext|>
|0| What? What do you want?<|endoftext|>
|1| A simple life. But you didn't hit the boy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, I will next time.<|endoftext|>
|1| You see, you won't. Now why? What am I missing?<|endoftext|>
|0| Get out. Get out of this house.<|endoftext|>
|1| The chairs. Of course, the chairs. Stupid me, the chairs.<|endoftext|>
|0| The chairs?<|endoftext|>
|1| There's a portrait on the wall behind me. Looks like you, butit's too old, so it's your father. All the chairs are angled away fromit. Daddy's been dead for twenty years, but you still can't getcomfortable where he can see you. There's a Christmas tree in thepainting, but none in this house, on Christmas Eve. You're scared ofhim, and you're scared of being like him, and good for you, you're notlike him, not really. Do you know why?<|endoftext|>
|0| Why?<|endoftext|>
|1| Because you didn't hit the boy. Merry Christmas, MisterSardick.<|endoftext|>
|0| I despise Christmas.<|endoftext|>
|1| You shouldn't. It's very you.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's what? What do you mean?<|endoftext|>
|1| Halfway out of the dark.<|endoftext|>
|0| Get her downstairs with the others. And clean up this mess.<|endoftext|>
|0| Everything's offline. Secondary furnacejust vented.<|endoftext|>
|0| Have you got a plan yet?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, I do.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you lying?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, I am.<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't treat me like an idiot.<|endoftext|>
|0| Was he lying?<|endoftext|>
|0| No, no.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay<|endoftext|>
|1| The good news. I've tracked the machinethat unlocks the cloud belt. I could use it to clear you a flightcorridor and you could land easily.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, hey. Hey, that's great news.<|endoftext|>
|1| But I can't control the machine.<|endoftext|>
|0| Less great.<|endoftext|>
|1| But I've met a man who can.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ah, well<|endoftext|>
|0| There you go.<|endoftext|>
|1| And he hates me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Were you being<|endoftext|>
|0| Extra charming and clever?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah. How did you know?<|endoftext|>
|0| Lucky guess.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sir? Sir.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hang on.<|endoftext|>
|0| I've never seen anybody stand up to Mister Sardick like that.Bless you, sir, and merry Christmas.<|endoftext|>
|1| Merry Christmas. Lovely. Sorry, bit busy.<|endoftext|>
|0| You'd better get inside, sir. The fog's thick tonight, andthere's a fish warning.<|endoftext|>
|1| All right, yeah. Sorry, fish?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah. You know what they're like when they get a bit hungry.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, fish, I know fish. Fish?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's all Mister Sardick's fault, I reckon. He always lets afew fish through the cloud layer when he's in a bad mood. Thank you.Bless you once again, sir.<|endoftext|>
|1| Fish?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, the Captain says we've got less thanan hour.<|endoftext|>
|0| What should we be doing?<|endoftext|>
|1| Fish.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry, what?<|endoftext|>
|1| Fish that can swim in fog. I love new planets.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, please don't get distracted.<|endoftext|>
|1| Now, why would people be frightened of you tiny little fellows?Look at you, sweet little fishy-wishies. Mind you, fish in the fog, sothe cloud cover. Ooo. Careful up there.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh great, thanks, Doctor, because there was areal danger we were all going to nod off. We've got less than an hour!<|endoftext|>
|1| I know.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ding dong merrily on high<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|0| How are you getting us off here?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, just give me a minute. Can't use theTardis, because it can't lock on. So, that ship needs to land. But itcan't land unless a very bad man suddenly decides to turn nice just intime for Christmas Day.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, I can't hear you. What is that? Isthat singing?<|endoftext|>
|1| A Christmas carol.<|endoftext|>
|0| A what?<|endoftext|>
|1| A Christmas carol.<|endoftext|>
|0| A what?<|endoftext|>
|1| A Christmas Carol!<|endoftext|>
|0| Hosanna in excelsis.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|0| Gloria<|endoftext|>
|1| Kazran Sardick.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|1| Merry Christmas, Kazran Sardick.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hosanna in excelsis.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello, my name is Kazran Sardick. I'm twelve and a half, andthis is my bedroom.<|endoftext|>
|0| Top secret special project.<|endoftext|>
|0| This is my top secret special project. Formy eyes only. Merry Christmas.<|endoftext|>
|0| Kazran!<|endoftext|>
|0| Kazran! Kazran, what are you doing? What are youdoing? I've warned you before about this, you stupid, ignorant,ridiculous child.<|endoftext|>
|0| I was just going to make a film of the fish.<|endoftext|>
|0| The fish are dangerous.<|endoftext|>
|0| I just want to see them.<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't be stupid. You're far too young.<|endoftext|>
|0| Everyone at school's seen the fish.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's enough. You'll be singing to them next, likegypsies.<|endoftext|>
|0| The singing works. I've seen it. The fish like thesinging.<|endoftext|>
|0| What does it matter what fish like?<|endoftext|>
|0| People say we don't have to be afraid of the fish.They're not really interested in us.<|endoftext|>
|0| You don't listen to people. You listen to me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ow! I'm sorry, Father.<|endoftext|>
|0| This is my house. While you're under my roof,you'll obey my instructions. I don't care what you<|endoftext|>
|1| It's okay, it's okay.<|endoftext|>
|0| What have you done? What is this?<|endoftext|>
|1| Found it on an old drive. Sorry about the picture quality. Hadto recover the data using quantum enfolding and a paperclip. Oh, Iwouldn't bother calling your servants. They quit. Apparently they wonthe lottery at exactly the same time, which is a bit lucky when youthink about it.<|endoftext|>
|0| There isn't a lottery.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, as I say, lucky.<|endoftext|>
|0| There's a fog warning tonight. You keep thesewindows closed, understand? Closed.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who are you?<|endoftext|>
|1| Tonight, I'm a Ghost Of Christmas Past.<|endoftext|>
|0| Mrs Mantovani will be looking after you tonight.You stay here till she comes. Do you understand? Do you understand?<|endoftext|>
|1| Did you ever get to see a fish, back then, when you were a kid?<|endoftext|>
|0| What does that matter to you?<|endoftext|>
|1| Look how it mattered to you.<|endoftext|>
|0| I cried all night, and I learned life's most invaluablelesson.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah. Which is?<|endoftext|>
|0| Nobody comes. Get out! Get out of my house!<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay. Okay, but I'll be back. Way back. Way, way back.<|endoftext|>
|0| See? Back.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who are you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Hi. I'm the Doctor. I'm your new babysitter.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where's Mrs Mantovani?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, you'll never guess. Clever old Mrs Manters, sheonly went and won the lottery.<|endoftext|>
|0| There isn't any lottery.<|endoftext|>
|0| There isn't any lottery.<|endoftext|>
|0| I know. What a woman.<|endoftext|>
|0| If you're my babysitter, why are you climbing inthe window?<|endoftext|>
|1| Because if I was climbing out of the window, I'd be going inthe wrong direction. Pay attention.<|endoftext|>
|0| But Mrs Mantovani's always my babysitter.<|endoftext|>
|0| Times change. Wouldn't you say? You see? ChristmasPast.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who are you talking to?<|endoftext|>
|0| You. Now, your past is going to change. That meansyour memories will too. Bit scary, but you'll get the hang of it.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't understand.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'll bet you don't. I wish I could see your face.<|endoftext|>
|0| But that never happened. But it did.<|endoftext|>
|1| Right then, your bedroom. Great. Let's see.You're twelve years old, so we'll stay away from under the bed.Cupboard! Big cupboard. I love a cupboard. Do you know, there's a thingcalled a face spider. It's just like a tiny baby's head with spiderlegs, and it's specifically evolved to scuttle up the backs of bedroomcupboards which, yeah, I probably shouldn't have mentioned. Right. So.What are we going to do? Eat crisps and talk about girls? I've neveractually done that, but I bet it's easy. Girls? Yeah?<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you really a babysitter?<|endoftext|>
|1| I think you'll find I'm universally recognised as a mature andresponsible adult.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's just a lot of wavy lines.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, it's shorted out. Finally, a lie too big. Okay, no, notreally a babysitter, but it's Christmas Eve. You don't want a real one.You want me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why? What's so special about you?<|endoftext|>
|1| Have you ever seen Mary Poppins?<|endoftext|>
|0| No.<|endoftext|>
|1| Good. Because that comparison would've been rubbish. Fish inthe fog. Fish in the clouds. How do people ever get bored? How didboredom even get invented?<|endoftext|>
|0| My dad's invented a machine to control the cloud belt. Tame thesky, he says. The fish'll be able to come down, but only when we letthem. We can charge whatever we like.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah. I've seen your dad's machine.<|endoftext|>
|0| What? You can't have.<|endoftext|>
|1| Tame the sky. Human beings. You always manage to find theboring alternative, don't you? You want to see one? A fish. We can dothat. We can see a fish.<|endoftext|>
|0| Aren't you going to tell me it's dangerous?<|endoftext|>
|1| Dangerous? Come on, we're boys. And you know what boys say inthe face of danger.<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|1| Mummy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are there any face spiders in here?<|endoftext|>
|1| Nah, not at this time of night. They'll all be sleeping in yourmattress.So, why are you so interested in fish?<|endoftext|>
|0| Because they're scary.<|endoftext|>
|0| What kind of tie is that?<|endoftext|>
|1| A cool one.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why is it cool?<|endoftext|>
|1| Why are you really interested in fish?<|endoftext|>
|0| My school. During the last fog belt, the nets broke and therewas an attack. Loads of them. A whole shoal. No one was hurt, but itwas the most fish ever seen below the mountains.<|endoftext|>
|1| Were you scared?<|endoftext|>
|0| I wasn't there. I was off sick.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ooo, lucky you. Not lucky.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's all anyone ever talks about now. The day the fish came.Everyone's got a story.<|endoftext|>
|1| But you don't.<|endoftext|>
|0| I see.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why are you recording this?<|endoftext|>
|0| Do you pay attention at school, Kazran?<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry, what?<|endoftext|>
|1| Because you're not paying attention now.<|endoftext|>
|1| Shush.<|endoftext|>
|0| Now I remember. No, Doctor, you mustn't!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, are you sure?<|endoftext|>
|1| Trust me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oi. Eyes on the tie. Look at me. I wear it and I don't care.Trust me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|1| That's why it's cool.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hello, fishy. Let's see. Interesting. Crystalline fog, eh?Maybe carrying a tiny electrical charge. Is that how you fly, littlefishy?<|endoftext|>
|0| What is it?<|endoftext|>
|0| What kind? Can I see?<|endoftext|>
|0| Just stay there a moment.<|endoftext|>
|0| Is it big?<|endoftext|>
|1| Nah, just a little one. So, little fellow, what do you eat?<|endoftext|>
|0| How little?<|endoftext|>
|1| Er.<|endoftext|>
|0| Can I come out?<|endoftext|>
|1| No, no. Maybe just wait there for a moment.<|endoftext|>
|0| What colour is it?<|endoftext|>
|1| Big. Big colour.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's happening?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, concentrating on the plusses, you've definitely got astory of your own now. Also, I got a good look at the fish, and I thinkI understand how the fog works, which is going to help me land aspaceship in the future and save a lot of lives. And I bet I get somevery interesting readings off my sonic screwdriver when I get it backfrom the shark in your bedroom.<|endoftext|>
|0| There's a shark in my bedroom?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh fine, focus on that part.<|endoftext|>
|0| Has it gone? What's it doing?<|endoftext|>
|1| What do you call it if you don't have any feet, and you'retaking a run-up?<|endoftext|>
|0| No! It's going to eat us.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's going to eat us. It's going to eat us.It's going to eat us. Is it going to eat us?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, maybe we're going to eat it, but I don't like the odds.It's stuck, though. Let's see. Tiny shark brain. If I had myscrewdriver, I could probably send a pulse and stun it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, where's your screwdriver?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, concentrating on the plusses, within reach. You know,there's a realchance the way it's wedged in the doorway is keeping its mouth open.<|endoftext|>
|0| There is?<|endoftext|>
|1| Just agree with me, because I've only got two goes, and thenit's your turn.<|endoftext|>
|0| Two goes?<|endoftext|>
|1| Two arms. Right, then. Okay. Geronimo. Open wide.<|endoftext|>
|1| What's the big fishy done to you? Swallowed half of you, that'swhat. Half a screwdriver, what use is that? Bad, big fishy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor? I think she's dying.<|endoftext|>
|1| Half my screwdriver's still inside, but yeah, I think so. Idoubt they can survive long outside the cloud belt. Just quick raidingtrips on a foggy night.<|endoftext|>
|0| Can't we get it back up there? We were just going to stun it. Ididn't want to kill it.<|endoftext|>
|1| She was trying to eat you.<|endoftext|>
|0| She was hungry.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm sorry, Kazran. I can't save her.<|endoftext|>
|1| I could take her back up there, but she'dnever survive the trip. We need a fully functioning life-support.<|endoftext|>
|0| You mean like an icebox?<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ooo, a tree.<|endoftext|>
|1| What is this?<|endoftext|>
|0| The surplus population. That's what my Dad calls it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, it's not turning. Oh, why won't it turn?<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah, what's the number?<|endoftext|>
|0| Seven two five eight.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't know.<|endoftext|>
|1| This place is full of alarms. It's not just the door. I needthe number.<|endoftext|>
|0| Seven two five eight.<|endoftext|>
|1| I need the number.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm not allowed to know until I'm older.<|endoftext|>
|0| Seven two five eight.<|endoftext|>
|1| Just what I was after. Thank you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Seven two five eight. Seven two five eight.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah, there's fish down here, too.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, but only tiny ones. The house is built on a fog lake,that's how Dad freezes the people. They're all full, but we couldborrow one. Yeah, this one.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hello again.<|endoftext|>
|0| You know her?<|endoftext|>
|1| Why her? Important, is she?<|endoftext|>
|0| She won't mind. She loves the fish.<|endoftext|>
|0| My name is Abigail Pettigrew, and I'm very grateful for MisterSardick's kindness. My father<|endoftext|>
|0| She starts to talk about the fish in a minute.<|endoftext|>
|0| But I would not allow it. I could not have chosen this pathwere it not for the compassion and generosity of the greatphilanthropist and patron of the poor, Mister Elliot Sardick. But I'malso surrounded by the fish, the beautiful, iridescent, magical fish.<|endoftext|>
|1| Why are these people here?<|endoftext|>
|0| they dash beneath the light as they dart through the fog.<|endoftext|>
|1| What's all this for?<|endoftext|>
|0| My dad lends money. He always takes a family member as, hecalls it security.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hard man to love, your dad. But I suppose you know that.<|endoftext|>
|0| Nature. I am not alone, and I am at peace.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's wrong?<|endoftext|>
|1| Just my half a screwdriver trying to repair itself. It'ssignalling the other half.<|endoftext|>
|0| The other half's inside the shark.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah? Sounds like she's woken up. Okay, so it's homing on thescrewdriver.<|endoftext|>
|0| Run! Run!<|endoftext|>
|0| (sings) In the bleak midwinter, frosty wind made moan. Earthstood hard as iron, water like a stone. Snow had fallen, snow on snow,snow on snow. In the bleak midwinter long ago.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's not really the singing, of course.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, it is.<|endoftext|>
|1| Nah.<|endoftext|>
|0| The fish love the singing. It's true.<|endoftext|>
|1| Nah. The notes resonate in the ice crystals, causing a deltawave pattern in the fog. Ow. A fish bit me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Shut up, then.<|endoftext|>
|0| Heaven and earth shall flee away<|endoftext|>
|1| Of course. That's how the machine controls the cloud belt. Theclouds are ice crystals. If you vibrate the crystals at exactly theright frequency, you could align them into ow! Why do they keep bitingme?<|endoftext|>
|0| Look, the fish like the singing, okay? Now shut up.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay.<|endoftext|>
|0| In the bleak midwinter, falling down before, the ox and assand camel which adore.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's bigger on<|endoftext|>
|0| The inside.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, it's the colour. Really knocks the walls back.<|endoftext|>
|1| Shark in a box, to go.<|endoftext|>
|0| Abigail.<|endoftext|>
|0| This is amazing.<|endoftext|>
|1| Nah, this is transport. I keep amazing out here.<|endoftext|>
|1| Come on, then. Let's get this shark out.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hey, look at her go.<|endoftext|>
|1| Abigail, this number. What does it mean?<|endoftext|>
|0| It pertains to me, sir, not the fish.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, but how?<|endoftext|>
|0| You are a doctor, you say? Are you one of mine?<|endoftext|>
|1| Do you need a doctor?<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah. Sorry. Time's up, kids.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's nearly Christmas Day.<|endoftext|>
|0| If you should ever wish to visit again.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, you know, if I'm ever in the neighbourhood.<|endoftext|>
|0| He comes every Christmas Eve.<|endoftext|>
|1| What?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, he does. Every time. He promises.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, I don't.<|endoftext|>
|0| Merry Christmas!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor! What are we going to do?<|endoftext|>
|0| The Doctor's got a great plan. Wait till you hear.<|endoftext|>
|0| You are out of your mind. This will neverwork.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, don't think shark, think dolphin.<|endoftext|>
|0| A shark isn't a dolphin.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's nearly a dolphin.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, it isn't.<|endoftext|>
|1| That's where you're wrong, because. Shut up.<|endoftext|>
|0| It could be anywhere. Will it really come?<|endoftext|>
|1| No chance. Completely impossible. Except at Christmas.<|endoftext|>
|0| How are we going to get back?<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't know.<|endoftext|>
|0| Do you have a plan?<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't know.<|endoftext|>
|0| Best Christmas Eve ever.<|endoftext|>
|0| Till the next one.<|endoftext|>
|0| New memories. How can I have new memories?<|endoftext|>
|0| Merry Christmas!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor. Where to this time?<|endoftext|>
|1| Did I mention, at any point, all of time and space?<|endoftext|>
|0| Merry Christmas!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| Merry Christmas!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Merry Christmas!<|endoftext|>
|0| Kazran.<|endoftext|>
|0| You've grown.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| And now you're blushing.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm sorry.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's okay.<|endoftext|>
|0| So, Doctor, where this time?<|endoftext|>
|1| Pick a Christmas Eve. I've got them all right here.<|endoftext|>
|0| Might I make a request?<|endoftext|>
|1| Of course.<|endoftext|>
|0| This one.<|endoftext|>
|0| Thank you, darling.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who are they?<|endoftext|>
|1| Her family. The lady's her sister. I met her once, when she wasolder.<|endoftext|>
|0| Abigail's crying.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| When girls are crying, are you supposed to talk to them?<|endoftext|>
|1| I have absolutely no idea.<|endoftext|>
|0| My sister's family. They're so happy.<|endoftext|>
|0| They look very poor.<|endoftext|>
|0| They are very poor. Doesn't mean you can't be happy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Close the curtains.<|endoftext|>
|0| And then why aren't you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Because this is the life I can never have.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why not?<|endoftext|>
|0| I think you're blushing again.<|endoftext|>
|1| Come in.<|endoftext|>
|1| Pick a card. Any card at all.<|endoftext|>
|0| Every Christmas Eve? I don't understand.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm not sure I do.<|endoftext|>
|1| You memorise the card, you put it back in the deck. Don't letme see it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Is this what it looked like last year?<|endoftext|>
|0| It doesn't have to be exactly the same.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm starting again. Come on, Kazran, we're starting again.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's Sardick's boy, isn't it?<|endoftext|>
|0| He's not like his father.<|endoftext|>
|0| His father treats everyone like cattle. One day that boy willdo the same.<|endoftext|>
|0| No. He's different.<|endoftext|>
|1| The three of clubs.<|endoftext|>
|0| No.<|endoftext|>
|1| You sure? Because I'm very good at card tricks.<|endoftext|>
|0| It wasn't the three of clubs.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, of course it wasn't, because it was the seven ofdiamonds.<|endoftext|>
|0| No.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oi, stop it, you're doing it wrong.<|endoftext|>
|0| I see him around the town sometimes. Never any friends.<|endoftext|>
|0| He's got me.<|endoftext|>
|0| All those Christmas Eves, you never once came to see us.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm here now.<|endoftext|>
|0| Then stay. Stay for tomorrow. Have Christmas dinner with us.<|endoftext|>
|0| I can't.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, then. Tomorrow's Christmas dinner is cancelled, as mysister refuses to attend.<|endoftext|>
|0| Isabella<|endoftext|>
|0| Instead, we'll have it tonight.<|endoftext|>
|1| Three, two, one, pull!<|endoftext|>
|0| How did you do that?<|endoftext|>
|1| Your card, I believe.<|endoftext|>
|0| No.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, shut up.<|endoftext|>
|0| Er, Merry Christmas.<|endoftext|>
|0| Merry Christmas.<|endoftext|>
|0| Best Christmas Eve ever.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah. Till the next one.<|endoftext|>
|0| I look forward to it. Now I'd like to say good night toKazran.<|endoftext|>
|1| Of course, yes. Well, on you go. Oh. Oh. Yes. Right. Sorry.I'll, er, I'll go, then. Good night. (to Kazran) Good luck. Night. Goodnight.<|endoftext|>
|1| Sorry.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor. I, er, I think she's going to kiss me.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, I think you're right.<|endoftext|>
|0| I've never kissed anyone before. What do I do?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, try and be all nervous and rubbish and a bit shaky.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why?<|endoftext|>
|1| Because you're going to be like that anyway. Might as well makeit part of the plan, then it'll feel on purpose. Off you go, then.<|endoftext|>
|0| What, now? I kiss her now?<|endoftext|>
|1| Kazran, trust me. It's this or go to your room and design a newkind of screwdriver. Don't make my mistakes. Now, go.<|endoftext|>
|0| Abigail, are you coming back? The Doctor is going to do a duetwith Frank. Abigail? What's wrong?<|endoftext|>
|0| I have something to tell you.<|endoftext|>
|0| A bad thing?<|endoftext|>
|0| A very bad thing.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is it?<|endoftext|>
|0| The truth.<|endoftext|>
|1| Guys, we've really got to go quite quickly. I just accidentallygot engaged to Marilyn Monroe. How do you keep going like that? Do youbreathe out your ears? Hello? Sorry. Hello? Guys, she's phoned achapel. There's a car outside. This is happening now.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yoo-hoo!<|endoftext|>
|1| Yoo-hoo. Right. Fine. Thank you. I'll just go and get marriedthen, shall I? See how you like that. Marilyn? Get your coat!<|endoftext|>
|0| What are we going to do?<|endoftext|>
|0| There is nothing to be done.<|endoftext|>
|0| Good night, Abigail.<|endoftext|>
|0| Good night, Kazran.<|endoftext|>
|1| There we go. Another day, another Christmas Eve. I'll see youin a minute, eh? I mean, a year.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor? Listen, why don't we leave it?<|endoftext|>
|1| Sorry, leave what?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, you know, this. Every Christmas Eve. It's getting a bitold.<|endoftext|>
|1| Old?<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, Christmas is for kids, isn't it? I've got some work withmy dad now. I'm going to focus on that. Get that cloud belt undercontrol.<|endoftext|>
|1| Sorry, I didn't realise I was boring you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Not your fault. Times change.<|endoftext|>
|1| Not as much as I'd hoped. Kazran. I'll be needing a new one,anyway. What the hell.<|endoftext|>
|1| Merry Christmas. And if you ever need me, just activate it.I'll hear you.<|endoftext|>
|0| I won't need you.<|endoftext|>
|1| What's happened? What are you not telling me? What aboutAbigail?<|endoftext|>
|0| I know where to find her.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah.<|endoftext|>
|0| Another Christmas Eve, Kazran. But a very special one. It'scomplete. Look at it. Sound waves. As simple as that. We can controlthe clouds, the fog, the fish.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why do we want to control the fish?<|endoftext|>
|0| People are cattle. If you want to control cattle, you need tocontrol their predators. What's the face for? Look what I'm giving you.The sky, and everything beneath it. Only you and I can control this.This planet is ours.<|endoftext|>
|0| Excuse me, Father.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, what? Oh, Mister President, we've been through this. It'snot going to crash on my house, so what's it got to do with me? Yes, Iknow. four thousand and three. As a very old friend of mine once took avery long time to explain, life isn't fair.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who are you? What are you doing here?<|endoftext|>
|0| You didn't think this was over, did you? I'm the Ghost ofChristmas Present.<|endoftext|>
|0| A ghost? Dressed like that?<|endoftext|>
|0| Eyes off the skirt.<|endoftext|>
|0| You turned into a Roman.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah. Yeah, I do that. I also do this.<|endoftext|>
|0| Do what? What are you talking about?<|endoftext|>
|0| Silent night, holy night.<|endoftext|>
|0| (sing) All is calm, all is bright, roundyon virgin mother and child, Holy infant so tender and mild. Christ theSaviour is born. Christ the Saviour is born.<|endoftext|>
|0| They're holograms. Projections, like me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who are they?<|endoftext|>
|0| The people on the ship up there. The ones that you're going to letdie tonight.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why are they singing?<|endoftext|>
|0| For their lives. Which one's Abigail? The Doctor told me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Did he now?<|endoftext|>
|0| AH, he doesn't hold back. You know the Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| How do I? I never met him before tonight. Now I seem to haveknown him all my life. How? Why?<|endoftext|>
|0| You're the only person who can let that ship land. He was tryingto turn you into a nicer person. And he was trying to do it nicely.<|endoftext|>
|0| He's changed my past, my whole life.<|endoftext|>
|0| Time can be rewritten.<|endoftext|>
|0| You tell the Doctor. Tell him from me, people can't.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's Abigail?<|endoftext|>
|0| I would never have known her if the Doctor hadn't changed thecourse of my whole life to suit himself.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, that's good, isn't it?<|endoftext|>
|0| No.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why is she still in there? You could let her out any time.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, yes. Any time at all. Any time I choose.<|endoftext|>
|0| Then why don't you?<|endoftext|>
|0| This is what the Doctor did to me. Abigail was ill when shewent into the ice. On the point of death. I suppose the rest in the icehelped her. But she's used up her time. All those Christmas Eves withme. I could release her any time I want, and she would live a singleday. So tell me, Ghost of Christmas Present, how do I choose which day?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm sorry. I really am. I'm very, very sorry. But you know what?She's got more time left than I have. More than anyone on this ship.<|endoftext|>
|0| Good.<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory, widen the beam.<|endoftext|>
|0| Status update on engine one.<|endoftext|>
|0| How did I get here?<|endoftext|>
|0| You didn't. It's your turn to be the hologram. Since you're goingto let a lot of people die, I thought you might like to see where it'sall going to happen.<|endoftext|>
|0| The singing. What is it? I don't understand.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's the Doctor's idea. The harmonies resonate in the icecrystals, that's why thee fish like it. He thought maybe it wouldstabilise the ship. But it isn't working. It's not powerful enough.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why are they still singing, then?<|endoftext|>
|0| Because we haven't told them. Sir, I understand you have amachine that controls this cloud layer. If you can release us from it,we still have time to make a landing. Nobody has to die.<|endoftext|>
|0| Everybody has to die.<|endoftext|>
|0| Not tonight.<|endoftext|>
|0| Tonight's as good as any other. How do you choose?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah?<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you hearing this?<|endoftext|>
|0| I can hear.<|endoftext|>
|0| He's here? Where is he? Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm sorry. I didn't realise.<|endoftext|>
|0| All my life, I've been called heartless. My other life, myreal life, the one you rewrote. Now look at me.<|endoftext|>
|1| Better a broken heart than no heart at all.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, try it. You try it. Why are you here?<|endoftext|>
|1| Because I'm not finished with you yet. You've seen the past,the present, and now you need to see the future.<|endoftext|>
|0| Fine. Do it. Show me. I'll die cold, alone and afraid. Ofcourse I will. We all do. What difference does showing me make? Do youknow why I'm going to let those people die? It's not a plan. I don'tget anything from it. It's just that I don't care. I'm not like you. Idon't even want to be like you. I don't and never, ever will care.<|endoftext|>
|1| And I don't believe that.<|endoftext|>
|0| Then show me the future. Prove me wrong.<|endoftext|>
|1| I am showing it to you. I'm showing it to you right now. Sowhat do you think? Is this who you want to become, Kazran?<|endoftext|>
|0| Dad?<|endoftext|>
|0| This planet is ours.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry. It's okay, don't be frightened.I'm, I'm so, so, so<|endoftext|>
|1| Kazran. We don't have much time.<|endoftext|>
|0| Structural integrity at thirty percent.<|endoftext|>
|0| We have five minutes max. We need to land.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello? Hello? Ah, hello, everyone. Prepare tolock on to my signal.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, what's happening?<|endoftext|>
|0| I just saved Christmas. Don't go away.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor? Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|1| We good to go, then?<|endoftext|>
|0| The controls, they won't respond.<|endoftext|>
|1| Of course they will. They're isomorphic. They're tuned to yourbrainwaves. They'll only respond to you.<|endoftext|>
|0| They won't respond.<|endoftext|>
|1| That doesn't make sense. That's ridiculous. Why wouldn't? Oh.Oh, of course. Stupid, stupid Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's wrong? Tell me, what is it?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's you. It's you. I've changed you too much. The machinedoesn't recognise you.<|endoftext|>
|0| But my father programmed it.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, your father would never have programmed it for the man youare now.<|endoftext|>
|0| Then what do we do?<|endoftext|>
|1| Er, er, I don't know. I don't know.<|endoftext|>
|0| There must be something.<|endoftext|>
|0| This. You can use this. I kept it, see?<|endoftext|>
|1| What, half a screwdriver? With the other half up in the sky ina big old shark, right in the heart of the cloud layer. If we use youraerial to boost the signal, set up a resonation pattern between the twohalves. Ooo, come on, that would work. My screwdriver, coolest bit ofkit on this planet. Coolest two bits. It could do it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Do what?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, my screwdriver is still trying to repair. It's signallingitself. We use the signal, but we send something else.<|endoftext|>
|0| Send what?<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, what? What?<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm sorry, Kazran. I truly am.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't understand.<|endoftext|>
|1| Her voice resonates perfectly with the icecrystals. It calmed the shark. It will calm the sky, too.<|endoftext|>
|0| Could you do it? Could you do this? Think about it, Doctor.One last day with your beloved. Which day would you choose?<|endoftext|>
|0| Christmas. Christmas Day. Look at you. You're so old now. Ithink you waited a bit too long, didn't you?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm sorry.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hoarding my days, like an old miser.<|endoftext|>
|0| But if you leave the ice now<|endoftext|>
|0| We've had so many Christmas Eves, Kazran. I think it's timefor Christmas Day.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|0| We can't hold this. Time's up. We're going down.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|0| Captain, I've got. I don't know what I've got.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is that? What are you listening to?<|endoftext|>
|0| This is coming from outside. This is coming from the actualclouds.<|endoftext|>
|0| (sings) When you're alone, silence is all you know.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well? Well?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, the singing resonates in the crystals. It's feeding backand forth between the two halves of the screwdriver. Now, one song,filling the sky. The crystals will align and I'll feed in a controlledphase loop, and the clouds will unlock.<|endoftext|>
|0| What does that mean, unlock? What happens when a cloud unlocks?<|endoftext|>
|1| Something that hasn't happened in this town for a very longtime now.<|endoftext|>
|0| (sings) When you're alone, silence is all you see. When you'realone, silence is all you'll be.<|endoftext|>
|0| Give me your hand and come to me.<|endoftext|>
|0| We're flying normally.<|endoftext|>
|0| Can you land?<|endoftext|>
|0| I can even land well.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, he did it. The Doctor did it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, he gets all the credit. Which is actually fair enough, ifyou think about it.<|endoftext|>
|0| (sings) When you are here, music is all around. When you arenear, music is all around. Open your eyes, don't make a sound.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello, my old friend.<|endoftext|>
|0| (sings) Let in the shadow.<|endoftext|>
|1| Let's go.<|endoftext|>
|0| (sings) Let in the shadow, let in the light of your brightshadow. Let in the shadow, let in the shadow.<|endoftext|>
|0| (sings) Let in the light of your bright shadow.<|endoftext|>
|0| You know, that could almost be mistaken for a real person. Thesnowman isn't bad, either.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah, yes, you two. About time. Why are you dressed like that?<|endoftext|>
|0| Er, kind of lost our luggage. Kind of crash landed?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, but why are you dressed like that at all?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, they really love their snowmen around here, don't they? I'vecounted about twenty.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, I've been busy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah. Yeah, you have. Thank you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Pleasure. Right, come on then, let's go.<|endoftext|>
|0| Got any more honeymoon ideas?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, there's a moon that's made of actual honey. Well, notactual honey, and it's not actually a moon, and technically it's alive,and a bit carnivorous, but there are some lovely views.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah. Great. Thanks.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you, are you okay?<|endoftext|>
|1| Of course I'm okay. You?<|endoftext|>
|0| Of course. It'll be their last day together, won't it?<|endoftext|>
|1| Everything has got to end some time, otherwise nothing wouldever get started.<|endoftext|>
|0| Your phone was ringing. Someone called Marilyn. Actually soundslike the Marilyn.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|1| Tell her I'll phone her back. And that was never a real chapel.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where are they? Kazran and Abigail.<|endoftext|>
|1| Off on a little trip, I should think.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where?<|endoftext|>
|1| Christmas.<|endoftext|>
|0| Christmas?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, Christmas.<|endoftext|>
|1| Halfway out of the dark.<|endoftext|>
|0| Out of my way!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor! Doctor! Doctor! Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|0| Where's the Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor who?<|endoftext|>
|0| Achoo!<|endoftext|>
|1| You know, this isn't nearly as bad as it looks.<|endoftext|>
|0| At the personal intervention of the King, the unnamed Doctor wasincarcerated without trial in the Tower of London.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, but it doesn't have to be him.<|endoftext|>
|0| According to contemporary accounts, two nights later, a magicalsphere some twenty feet across, was seen floating away from the tower,bearing the mysterious Doctor aloft.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay. It's him.<|endoftext|>
|0| There's more.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor. Doctor, what can you see?<|endoftext|>
|1| Is the commandant's office painted a sort of green colour witha big flag on the wall?<|endoftext|>
|1| I think the answer's probably yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's like he's being deliberately ridiculous,trying to attract our attention. Are you watching this again?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah. I've explained the jokes.<|endoftext|>
|0| So what are you saying? Do you really think he's back there,trying to wave to us, out of history books?<|endoftext|>
|0| Hey, it's the sort of thing he'd do. Thanks.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, but why?<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, he said he'd be in touch.<|endoftext|>
|0| Two months ago.<|endoftext|>
|0| Two months is nothing. He's up to something. I know he is. I knowhim.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is it? Amy?<|endoftext|>
|0| A date, a time, a map reference. I think it's an invitation.<|endoftext|>
|0| From who?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's not signed. Look, Tardis blue.<|endoftext|>
|0| You'd better get down here, sir. She's doing it again. DoctorSong, sir. She's packing. Says she's going to some planet calledAmerica.<|endoftext|>
|0| Thanks!<|endoftext|>
|0| You're very welcome.<|endoftext|>
|0| This is it, yeah? The right place?<|endoftext|>
|0| Nowhere, middle of? Yeah, this it.<|endoftext|>
|1| Howdy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|1| Ha, ha! It's the Pond.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hey!<|endoftext|>
|1| Hello, Pond. Come here.<|endoftext|>
|0| So, someone's been a busy boy then, eh?<|endoftext|>
|1| Did you see me?<|endoftext|>
|0| Of course.<|endoftext|>
|1| Stalker.<|endoftext|>
|0| Flirt.<|endoftext|>
|0| Husband.<|endoftext|>
|1| Rory the Roman! Ooo, come here.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hey, nice hat.<|endoftext|>
|1| I wear a Stetson now. Stetsons are cool.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello, sweetie.<|endoftext|>
|0| Right then, where are we? Have we done Easter Island yet?<|endoftext|>
|1| Er, yes! I've got Easter Island.<|endoftext|>
|0| They worshipped you there. Have you seen the statues?<|endoftext|>
|1| Jim the fish.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh! Jim the fish. How is he?<|endoftext|>
|1| Still building his dam.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry, what are you two doing?<|endoftext|>
|0| They're both time travellers, so they never meet in the rightorder. They're syncing their diaries. So, what's happening, then?Because you've been up to something.<|endoftext|>
|1| I've been running, faster than I've ever run. And I've beenrunning my whole life. Now, it's time for me to stop. And tonight, I'mgoing to need you all with me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay. We're here. What's up?<|endoftext|>
|1| A picnic. And then a trip. Somewhere different, somewhere brandnew.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where?<|endoftext|>
|1| Space, 1969.<|endoftext|>
|1| Salud!<|endoftext|>
|0| Salud.<|endoftext|>
|0| So, when are going to 1969?<|endoftext|>
|0| And since when do you drink wine?<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm eleven hundred and three. I must've drunk it sometime.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, why it's horrid. I thought it would taste more like thegums.<|endoftext|>
|0| Eleven hundred and three? You were nine hundred and eight the lasttime we saw you.<|endoftext|>
|1| And you've put on a couple of pounds. I wasn't going to mentionit.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who's that?<|endoftext|>
|0| Hmm? Who's who?<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry, what?<|endoftext|>
|0| What did you see? You said you saw something.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, I didn't.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah, the moon. Look at it. Of course, you lot did a lot morethan look, didn't you? Big, silvery thing in the sky. You couldn'tresist it. Quite right.<|endoftext|>
|0| The moon landing was in 69. Is that where we're going?<|endoftext|>
|1| No. A lot more happens in 69 than anyone remembers. Humanbeings. I thought I'd never get done saving you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who's he?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, my God.<|endoftext|>
|1| You all need to stay back. Whatever happens now, you do notinterfere. Clear?<|endoftext|>
|0| That's an astronaut. That's an Apollo astronaut in a lake.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hello. It's okay. I know it's you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well then.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's he doing?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy, stay back!<|endoftext|>
|0| The Doctor said stay back! You have to stay back!<|endoftext|>
|0| No! No! Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm sorry.<|endoftext|>
|0| No! Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, please!<|endoftext|>
|0| River. River! River? No.<|endoftext|>
|0| Of course not.<|endoftext|>
|0| River, he can't be dead. This isn't possible.<|endoftext|>
|0| Whatever that was, it killed him in the middle of hisregeneration cycle. His body was already dead. He didn't make it to thenext one.<|endoftext|>
|0| Maybe he's a clone or a duplicate or something.<|endoftext|>
|0| I believe I can save you some time. That most certainly isthe Doctor. And he is most certainly dead. He said you'd need this.<|endoftext|>
|0| Gasoline?<|endoftext|>
|0| A Time Lord's body is a miracle. Even a dead one. There arewhole empires out there who'd rip this world apart for just one cell.We can't leave him here. Or anywhere.<|endoftext|>
|0| Wake up. Come on, wake up, you stupid, bloody idiot. What do wedo, Rory?<|endoftext|>
|0| We're his friends. We do what the Doctor's friends always do. Aswe're told.<|endoftext|>
|0| There's a boat. If we're going to do this, let's do it properly.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who are you? Why did you come?<|endoftext|>
|0| The same reason as you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor Song, Amy, Rory. I'm Canton Everett Delaware thethird. I won't be seeing you again, but you'll be seeing me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Four.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry, what?<|endoftext|>
|0| The Doctor numbered the envelopes.<|endoftext|>
|0| You got 3, I was 2, Mister Delaware was 4.<|endoftext|>
|0| So?<|endoftext|>
|0| So, where's 1?<|endoftext|>
|0| What, you think he invited someone else?<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, he must have. He planned all of this, to the last detail.<|endoftext|>
|0| Will you two shut up? It doesn't matter.<|endoftext|>
|0| He was up to something.<|endoftext|>
|0| He's dead.<|endoftext|>
|0| Space, 1969. What did he mean?<|endoftext|>
|0| You're still talking, but it doesn't matter.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hey, it mattered to him.<|endoftext|>
|0| So it matters to us.<|endoftext|>
|0| He's dead.<|endoftext|>
|0| But he still needs us. I know. Amy, I know. But right now wehave to focus.<|endoftext|>
|0| Look.<|endoftext|>
|0| Excuse me, who was sitting over there?<|endoftext|>
|0| Some guy.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Doctor knew he was going to his death, so he sent outmessages. When you know it's the end, who do you call?<|endoftext|>
|0| Er, your friends. People you trust.<|endoftext|>
|0| Number 1. Who did The Doctor trust the most?<|endoftext|>
|0| This is cold. Even by your standards, this is cold.<|endoftext|>
|1| Or hello, as people used to say.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|1| I just popped out to get my special straw. It adds more fizz.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're okay. How can you be okay?<|endoftext|>
|1| Hey, of course I'm okay. I'm always okay. I'm the King of Okay.Oh, that's a rubbish title. Forget that title. Rory the Roman! That's agood title. Hello, Rory. And Doctor River Song. Oh, you bad, bad girl.What trouble have you got for me this time?<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay. I'm assuming that's for something I haven't done yet.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, it is.<|endoftext|>
|1| Good. Looking forward to it.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't understand. How can you be here?<|endoftext|>
|1| I was invited. Date, map reference. Same as you lot, I assume,otherwise it's a hell of a coincidence.<|endoftext|>
|0| River, what's going on?<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy, ask him what age he is.<|endoftext|>
|1| That's a bit personal.<|endoftext|>
|0| Tell her. Tell her what age you are.<|endoftext|>
|1| Nine hundred and nine.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, but you said you were<|endoftext|>
|0| So where does that leave us, huh? Jim the fish? Have we done Jimthe fish yet?<|endoftext|>
|1| Who's Jim the fish?<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't understand.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, you do.<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't! What are we all doing here?<|endoftext|>
|0| We've been recruited. Something to do with space 1969, and a mancalled Canton Everett Delaware the third.<|endoftext|>
|1| Recruited by who?<|endoftext|>
|0| Someone who trusts you more than anybody else in the universe.<|endoftext|>
|1| And who's that?<|endoftext|>
|0| Spoilers.<|endoftext|>
|1| 1969, that's an easy one! Funny, how someyears are easy. Now, 1482, full of glitches. Now then, Canton EverettDelaware the third. That was his name, yeah? How many of those canthere be? Well, three, I suppose. Rory, is everybody cross with me forsome reason?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'll find out.<|endoftext|>
|0| Explain it again.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Doctor we saw on the beach is a future version, two hundredyears older than the one up there.<|endoftext|>
|0| But all that's still going to happen. He's still going to die.<|endoftext|>
|0| We're all going to do that, Amy.<|endoftext|>
|0| We're not all going to arrange our own wake and invite ourselves.So, the Doctor, in the future, knowing he's going to die, recruits hisyounger self and all of us to, to what, exactly? Avenge him?<|endoftext|>
|0| Uh huh. Avenging's not his style.<|endoftext|>
|0| Save him.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, that's not really his style either.<|endoftext|>
|0| We have to tell him.<|endoftext|>
|0| We've told him all we can. We can't even tell him we've seen hisfuture self. He's interacted with his own past. It could rip a hole inthe universe.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, but he's done it before.<|endoftext|>
|0| And in fairness, the universe did blow up.<|endoftext|>
|0| But he'd want to know.<|endoftext|>
|0| Would he? Would anyone?<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm being extremely clever up here, and there's no one to standaround looking impressed! What's the point in having you all?<|endoftext|>
|0| Couldn't you just slap him sometimes?<|endoftext|>
|0| River, we can't just let him die. We have to stop it. How can yoube okay with this?<|endoftext|>
|0| The Doctor's death doesn't frighten me. Nor does my own. There'sa far worse day coming for me.<|endoftext|>
|1| Time isn't a straight line. It's all bumpywumpy. There's loads of boring stuff like Sundays and Tuesdays andThursday afternoons. But now and then there are Saturdays. Big temporaltipping points when anything's possible. The Tardis can't resist them,like a moth to a flame. She loves a party, so I give her 1969 and NASA,because that's space in the sixties, and Canton Everett Delaware thethird, and this is where she's pointing.<|endoftext|>
|0| Washington D.C., April the eighth, 1969. So why haven't we landed?<|endoftext|>
|1| Because that's not where we're going.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh. Where are we going?<|endoftext|>
|1| Home. Well, you two are. Off you pop and make babies. And you,Doctor Song, back to prison. And me? I'm late for a biplane lesson in1911. Or it could be knitting. Knitting or biplanes. One or the other.What? A mysterious summons. You think I'm just going to go? Who sentthose messages? I know you know. I can see it in your faces. Don't playgames with me. Don't ever, ever think you're capable of that.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're going to have to trust us this time.<|endoftext|>
|1| Trust you? Sure. But, first of all, Doctor Song, just onething. Who are you? You're someone from my future. Getting that. Butwho? Okay. Why are you in prison? Who did you kill, hmm? Now, I love abad girl, me, but trust you? Seriously.<|endoftext|>
|0| Trust me.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay.<|endoftext|>
|0| You have to do this, and you can't ask why.<|endoftext|>
|1| Are you being threatened? Is someone making you say that?<|endoftext|>
|0| No.<|endoftext|>
|1| You're lying.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm not lying.<|endoftext|>
|1| Swear to me. Swear to me on something that matters.<|endoftext|>
|0| Fish fingers and custard.<|endoftext|>
|1| My life in your hands, Amelia Pond.<|endoftext|>
|0| Thank you.<|endoftext|>
|1| So! Canton Everett Delaware the third. Who's he?<|endoftext|>
|0| Who wants to know?<|endoftext|>
|0| Your boss.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't have a boss anymore.<|endoftext|>
|0| Maybe you want to tell that to the President of the UnitedStates.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ex FBI. Got kicked out.<|endoftext|>
|1| Why?<|endoftext|>
|0| I understand that you have aproblem with authority.<|endoftext|>
|0| Thank you.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's not a compliment, son.<|endoftext|>
|0| Six weeks after he left the Bureau, thePresident contacted him for a private meeting.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, 1969. Who's President?<|endoftext|>
|0| This is a personal matter. I need someone onthe outside, someone with FBI training<|endoftext|>
|0| But who's not in contact withthem.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm flattered.<|endoftext|>
|0| You were my second choice for this, MisterDelaware.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's okay.<|endoftext|>
|0| You were my second choice for President,Mister Nixon.<|endoftext|>
|0| Richard Milhous Nixon. Vietnam, Watergate.There's some good stuff, too.<|endoftext|>
|1| Not enough.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hippie!<|endoftext|>
|1| Archaeologist.<|endoftext|>
|0| Every day, wherever I am, I get a phonecall.<|endoftext|>
|0| People can't just call you, Mister President.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's a direct call every time. Every day for the last two weeks,usually late at night.<|endoftext|>
|0| Man or woman?<|endoftext|>
|0| Neither. Listen.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay, since I don't know what I'm gettinginto this time, for once I'm being discreet. I'm putting the engines onsilent.<|endoftext|>
|1| Did you do something?<|endoftext|>
|0| No, just watching.<|endoftext|>
|1| Putting the outer shield on invisible. I haven't done this in awhile. Big drain on the power.<|endoftext|>
|0| You can turn the Tardis invisible?<|endoftext|>
|1| Ha!<|endoftext|>
|0| Very nearly.<|endoftext|>
|1| Er, did you touch something?<|endoftext|>
|0| Just admiring your skills, sweetie.<|endoftext|>
|1| Good. You might learn something. Okay. Now I can't check thescanner. It doesn't work when we're cloaked. Just give us a mo. Whoa!Whoa, whoa, whoa. You lot, wait a moment. We're in the middle of themost powerful city in the most powerful country on Earth. Let's take itslow.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello? Who is this? This is President Nixon. Who's calling?Is this you again?<|endoftext|>
|0| Mister President?<|endoftext|>
|0| A child.<|endoftext|>
|0| This is the President, yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm scared, Mister President. I'm scared of the spaceman.<|endoftext|>
|0| A little girl?<|endoftext|>
|0| Boy.<|endoftext|>
|0| How can you be sure?<|endoftext|>
|0| What spaceman? Where are you phoning from? Where are youright now? Who are you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Jefferson Adams Hamilton.<|endoftext|>
|0| Jefferson, listen to me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Surely this is something the Bureau could handle, sir.<|endoftext|>
|0| These calls happen wherever I am. How do I know the Bureau isn'tinvolved? I can't trust anyone<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh. Hello. Bad moment. Oh look, this is the Oval Office. I waslooking for the er, oblong room. I'll just be off, then, shall I?<|endoftext|>
|0| Every time.<|endoftext|>
|1| Don't worry! It always does that when itscloaked.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah, no. Stop that.<|endoftext|>
|0| He said the scanner wouldn't work.<|endoftext|>
|0| I know. Bless.<|endoftext|>
|0| Lockdown! Lockdown!<|endoftext|>
|0| Stop that! Argh! Oh!<|endoftext|>
|1| River, have you got my scanner<|endoftext|>
|0| Working yet?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, I hate him.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, you don't!<|endoftext|>
|0| Get the President out of here. Sir, you have to go with them,now.<|endoftext|>
|1| River, make her blue again!<|endoftext|>
|0| What the hell is that?<|endoftext|>
|1| Mister President, that child just told you everything you needto know, but you weren't listening. Never mind, though, because theanswer's yes. I'll take the case. Fellows, the guns, really? I justwalked into the highest security office in the United States and parkeda big blue box on the rug. Do you think you can just shoot me?<|endoftext|>
|0| They're Americans!<|endoftext|>
|1| Don't shoot. Definitely no shooting.<|endoftext|>
|0| Nobody shoot us either. Very much not in need of getting shot.Look, we've got our hands up.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who the hell are you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Sir, you need to stay back.<|endoftext|>
|0| But who are they and what is that box?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's a police box. Can't you read? I'm your new undercoveragent on loan from Scotland Yard. Code name the Doctor. These are mytop operatives, the Legs, the Nose, and Mrs Robinson.<|endoftext|>
|0| I hate you.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, you don't.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who are you?<|endoftext|>
|1| Nah, boring question. Who's phoning you? That's interesting.Because Canton Three is right. That was definitely a girl's voice,which means there's only one place in America she can be phoning from.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where?<|endoftext|>
|0| Do not engage with the intruder, Mister Delaware.<|endoftext|>
|0| How did you get it in here? I mean, you didn't carry it in.<|endoftext|>
|1| Clever, eh?<|endoftext|>
|0| Love it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Do not compliment the intruder.<|endoftext|>
|0| Five minutes?<|endoftext|>
|1| Five.<|endoftext|>
|0| Mister President, that man is a clear and present danger to<|endoftext|>
|0| Mister President, that man walked in here with a big blue boxand three of his friends, and that's the man he walked past. One ofthem's worth listening to. I say we give him five minutes. See if hedelivers.<|endoftext|>
|1| Thanks, Canton.<|endoftext|>
|0| If he doesn't, I'll shoot him myself.<|endoftext|>
|1| Not so thanks.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sir, I cannot recommend<|endoftext|>
|0| Shut up, Peterson! All right, five minutes.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm going to need a SWAT team, ready to mobilise. Street levelmaps covering all of Florida. A pot of coffee, twelveJammie Dodgers and a fez.<|endoftext|>
|0| Get him his maps.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why Florida?<|endoftext|>
|1| There's where NASA is. She mentioned a spaceman. NASA's wherethe spacemen live. Also, there's another lead I'm following.<|endoftext|>
|0| A spaceman, like the one we saw at the lake.<|endoftext|>
|0| Maybe. Probably.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who's that?<|endoftext|>
|0| I remember.<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy? What do you remember?<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't know. I just<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy, what's wrong?<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy?<|endoftext|>
|1| Are you all right?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah. No, I'm fine. I'm just feeling a little sick. Excuse me, isthere a toilet or something?<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry, ma'am, while this procedure's ongoing, you must remainwithin the Oval office.<|endoftext|>
|0| Shut up and take her to the restroom.<|endoftext|>
|0| This way, ma'am.<|endoftext|>
|0| Thanks.<|endoftext|>
|0| Your five minutes are up.<|endoftext|>
|0| Actually, I can usually manage this alone.<|endoftext|>
|0| Argh! I saw you before, at the lake. And here. But then I forgot.How did I forget? What are you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Get back. Stay back from it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Eek! Oh, my God. What is that? Is that a mask? Is that a Star Trekthing? Ben, is that you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Get back from it now!<|endoftext|>
|0| Back from what, honey?<|endoftext|>
|0| That.<|endoftext|>
|0| Eek! Oh, my God! Look at that. Is that a Star Trek mask? Ben,that's got to be you. Hang on, did I just say all that?<|endoftext|>
|0| No. Please, you've got to stay back.<|endoftext|>
|0| Back, honey? Back from what?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, those lights. They never fix them.<|endoftext|>
|0| Look behind you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Honey, there is nothing. Argh!<|endoftext|>
|0| You didn't have to kill her. She couldn't even remember you. Howdoes that work? We can only remember you while we're seeing you, isthat it?<|endoftext|>
|0| Why did you have to kill her?<|endoftext|>
|0| Joy. Her name was Joy. Your name is Amelia. You will tell theDoctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Tell him what?<|endoftext|>
|0| What he must know and what he must never know.<|endoftext|>
|0| How do you know about that?<|endoftext|>
|0| Tell him.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you okay?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm fine. Much better, thanks.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's that?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's my phone.<|endoftext|>
|0| Your phone?<|endoftext|>
|0| I have to tell the Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Tell him what, ma'am?<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry, I don't know why I said that.<|endoftext|>
|0| This way, ma'am.<|endoftext|>
|0| The kid?<|endoftext|>
|0| Should I answer it?<|endoftext|>
|1| Here! The only place in the United States that call could becoming from. See? Obvious, when you think about it.<|endoftext|>
|0| You, sir, are a genius.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's a hobby.<|endoftext|>
|0| Mister President, answer the phone.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello. This is President Nixon.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's here! The spaceman's here! It's going to getme! It's going to eat me!<|endoftext|>
|1| There's no time for a SWAT team. Let's go. Mister President,tell her help's on the way. Canton, on no account follow me into thisbox and close the door behind you.<|endoftext|>
|0| What the hell are you doing?<|endoftext|>
|0| Mister President, please help. Please help me!<|endoftext|>
|0| Jefferson, it's all right. I'm sending my best people.<|endoftext|>
|1| Jefferson isn't a girl's name. It's not hername either. Jefferson, Adams, Hamilton. River.<|endoftext|>
|0| Surnames of three of America's founding fathers.<|endoftext|>
|1| Lovely fellows. Two of them fancied me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you okay? Coping?<|endoftext|>
|1| You see, the President asked the child two questions. Where areyou and who are you? She was answering where.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's bigger on the inside.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, you get used to it.<|endoftext|>
|1| Now, where would you find three big, historical names in a rowlike that?<|endoftext|>
|0| Where?<|endoftext|>
|1| Here. Come on.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's er<|endoftext|>
|1| Are you taking care of this?<|endoftext|>
|0| Why is it always my turn?<|endoftext|>
|0| Because you're the newest.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where are we?<|endoftext|>
|1| About five miles from Cape Kennedy Space Centre. It's 1969, theyear of the moon. Interesting, don't you think?<|endoftext|>
|0| But why would a little girl be here?<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't know. Lost me a bit. The President asked the girl whereshe was, and she did what any lost little girl would do. She looked outof the window.<|endoftext|>
|0| Streets. Of course, street names.<|endoftext|>
|1| The only place in Florida, probably all of America, with thosethree street names on the same junction. And Doctor Song, you've gotthat face on again.<|endoftext|>
|0| What face?<|endoftext|>
|1| The he's hot when he's clever face.<|endoftext|>
|0| This is my normal face.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, it is.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, shut up.<|endoftext|>
|1| Not a chance.<|endoftext|>
|0| We've moved. How, how can we have moved?<|endoftext|>
|1| You haven't even got to space travel yet?<|endoftext|>
|0| I was going to cover it with time travel.<|endoftext|>
|0| Time travel.<|endoftext|>
|1| Brave heart, Canton. Come on.<|endoftext|>
|0| So we're in a box that's bigger on the inside, and it travelsthrough time and space.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, basically.<|endoftext|>
|0| How long have Scotland Yard had this?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's a warehouse of some kind. Disused.<|endoftext|>
|1| You realise this is almost certainly a trap, of course?<|endoftext|>
|0| I noticed the phone, yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| What about it?<|endoftext|>
|0| It was cut off. So how did the child phone from here?<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, but why would anyone want to trap us?<|endoftext|>
|1| Let's see if anyone tries to kill us and work backwards.<|endoftext|>
|0| Now, why would a little girl be here?<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't know. Let's find her and ask her.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's nonterrestrial. Definitely alien. Probably not even fromthis time zone.<|endoftext|>
|1| Which is odd, because look at this!<|endoftext|>
|0| It's earth tech. It's contemporary.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's very contemporary. Cutting edge. This is from the spaceprogram.<|endoftext|>
|0| Stolen?<|endoftext|>
|0| What, by aliens?<|endoftext|>
|1| Apparently.<|endoftext|>
|0| But why? I mean, if you can make it all the way to Earth, whysteal technology that can barely make it to the moon?<|endoftext|>
|1| Maybe because it's cooler? Look how cool this stuff is.<|endoftext|>
|0| Cool aliens?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, what would you call me?<|endoftext|>
|0| An alien.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oi!<|endoftext|>
|0| I, er, I think he's okay now.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah! Back with us, Canton.<|endoftext|>
|0| I like your wheels.<|endoftext|>
|1| That's my boy. So, come on. Little girl. Let's find her.<|endoftext|>
|0| River.<|endoftext|>
|0| I know what you're thinking.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, you don't.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're thinking if we can find the spaceman in 1969 andneutralise it, then it won't be around in 2011 to kill the Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, lucky guess.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's only because I was thinking it too.<|endoftext|>
|0| So let's do it.<|endoftext|>
|0| It doesn't work like that. We came here because of what we sawin the future. If we try and prevent the future from happening, wecreate a paradox.<|endoftext|>
|0| Time can be rewritten.<|endoftext|>
|0| Not all of it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Says who?<|endoftext|>
|0| Who do you think? What's this?<|endoftext|>
|0| We can still save him.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor? Look at this.<|endoftext|>
|1| So where does that go?<|endoftext|>
|0| There's a network of tunnels running under here.<|endoftext|>
|1| Life signs?<|endoftext|>
|0| No, nothing that's showing up.<|endoftext|>
|1| Those are the worst kind.<|endoftext|>
|1| Be careful.<|endoftext|>
|0| Careful? I tried that once. Ever so dull.<|endoftext|>
|1| Shout if you get in trouble.<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't worry, I'm quite the screamer. Now there's a spoiler foryou.<|endoftext|>
|0| Tell me what's going on here.<|endoftext|>
|1| Er, nothing. She's just a friend.<|endoftext|>
|0| I think he's talking about the possible alien incursion.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay.<|endoftext|>
|0| So, I was in a bar having a drink. Tell me, honestly, Am Istill there?<|endoftext|>
|0| Afraid not.<|endoftext|>
|0| All clear. Just tunnels. Nothing down there I can see. Er, giveme five minutes. I want to take another look around.<|endoftext|>
|1| Stupidly dangerous!<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, I like it too. Amy, look after him.<|endoftext|>
|1| Rory, would you mind going with her?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, a bit.<|endoftext|>
|1| Then I'd appreciate it all the more.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hang on, River. I'm coming too.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you okay?<|endoftext|>
|0| Ah. Yes, yes. I just felt a bit sick. It's the prison food,probably. Okay, this way? What do you think?<|endoftext|>
|0| I keep thinking I hear things.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's interesting. These tunnels are old. Really old. How canthey be really old and nobody notice them?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's a maintenance hatch.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's locked. Oh, why do people always lock things?<|endoftext|>
|0| What's through there?<|endoftext|>
|0| I've no idea.<|endoftext|>
|0| Something bad?<|endoftext|>
|0| Almost definitely.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're going to open it, aren't you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, it's locked. How's a girl supposed to resist?<|endoftext|>
|0| Is this sensible?<|endoftext|>
|0| God, I hope not.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, you and the Doctor. I can kind of picture it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Keep a look out.<|endoftext|>
|0| What did you mean? What you said to Amy. There's a worst daycoming for you.<|endoftext|>
|0| When I first met the Doctor, a long, long time ago, he knew allabout me. Think about that. An impressionable young girl and, suddenlythis man just drops out of the sky and he's clever and mad andwonderful, and knows every last thing about her. Imagine what that doesto a girl.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't really have to.<|endoftext|>
|0| The trouble is, it's all back to front. My past is his future.We're travelling in opposite directions. Every time we meet, I know himmore, he knows me less. I live for the days when I see him, but I knowthat every time I do, he'll be one step further away. And the day iscoming when I'll look into that man's eyes, my Doctor, and he won'thave the faintest idea who I am. And I think it's going to kill me.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is this place?<|endoftext|>
|0| That's an alarm. Check if anything's coming.<|endoftext|>
|0| There's nothing out there.<|endoftext|>
|0| These tunnels, they're not just here, they're everywhere.They're running under the surface of the entire planet. They've beenhere for centuries.<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory!<|endoftext|>
|0| So, you were kicked out of the FBI because youhad attitude problems?<|endoftext|>
|0| No, I just wanted to get married.<|endoftext|>
|0| Is that a crime?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes. Doctor who, exactly?<|endoftext|>
|0| Ah. That's classified.<|endoftext|>
|0| Classified by who?<|endoftext|>
|0| God knows.<|endoftext|>
|0| Do you work for him?<|endoftext|>
|0| He's my friend, if friend is the right word. I haven't seen him ina while. I had something I wanted to tell him, but stuff always gets inthe way.<|endoftext|>
|0| Stuff does that.<|endoftext|>
|0| Help me! Help! Help me!<|endoftext|>
|0| That's her.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy?<|endoftext|>
|0| Help me! Please!<|endoftext|>
|1| What's wrong?<|endoftext|>
|0| I need to tell you something. It's important.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|0| It's really, really important.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, quickly!<|endoftext|>
|1| What, now?<|endoftext|>
|1| Canton! Canton, are you okay?<|endoftext|>
|0| Is he all right?<|endoftext|>
|1| Just unconscious. Got a proper whack.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, I need to tell you something. I have to tell you it now.<|endoftext|>
|1| Not a great moment.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, it's important. It has to be now.<|endoftext|>
|0| Help! Help me! Help me!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, I'm pregnant.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's it. The astronaut.<|endoftext|>
|0| Help me!<|endoftext|>
|0| Get down!<|endoftext|>
|1| What are you doing?<|endoftext|>
|0| Saving your life!<|endoftext|>
|1| No!<|endoftext|>
|0| Suspect directly ahead. Coming to you now. Over.<|endoftext|>
|0| Canton.<|endoftext|>
|0| Miss Pond.<|endoftext|>
|0| Is that a body bag?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, it is.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's empty.<|endoftext|>
|0| How about that?<|endoftext|>
|0| Do you even know why you're doing this, eh? Can you even rememberthe warehouse?<|endoftext|>
|1| Canton. Amy. Amy!<|endoftext|>
|0| River, come on!<|endoftext|>
|1| Run!<|endoftext|>
|0| What the hell's going on?<|endoftext|>
|1| Look behind you.<|endoftext|>
|0| There's nothing behind me.<|endoftext|>
|1| Look. Look. Canton, look, I tell you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Canton.<|endoftext|>
|0| All visitors to remain behind the yellow line. All visitors toremain behind the yellow line. <|endoftext|>
|0| We found Amy Pond. She had strange markings on her arm. Do youknow what they are?<|endoftext|>
|1| Why don't you ask her?<|endoftext|>
|0| I see you. I see you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor Song? Doctor Song? Go! Go! Go!<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't move! It's over.<|endoftext|>
|0| They're here, Canton. They're everywhere.<|endoftext|>
|0| I know. America's being invaded.<|endoftext|>
|0| You were invaded a long time ago. America is occupied.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're coming with us, Doctor Song. There's no way out thistime.<|endoftext|>
|0| There's always a way out.<|endoftext|>
|0| We found Doctor Song.<|endoftext|>
|1| These bricks, what are they made of? Where is she?<|endoftext|>
|0| She ran. Off the fiftieth floor.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'd say zero balance dwarf star alloy. The densest material inthe universe. Nothing gets through that. You're building me the perfectprison. And it still won't be enough.<|endoftext|>
|0| What are you waiting for?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm waiting for you to run. It'd look better if I shot youwhile you're running. Then again, looks aren't everything.<|endoftext|>
|1| Is there a reason you're doing this?<|endoftext|>
|0| I want you to know where you stand.<|endoftext|>
|1| In a cell.<|endoftext|>
|0| In the perfect cell. Nothing can penetrate these walls. Not asound, not a radio wave, not the tiniest particle of anything.<|endoftext|>
|0| In here, you're literally cut off from the rest of theuniverse. So I guess they can't hear us, right?<|endoftext|>
|1| Good work, Canton. Door sealed?<|endoftext|>
|0| You bet.<|endoftext|>
|1| Are you okay?<|endoftext|>
|0| Finally.<|endoftext|>
|0| These things could really do with air holes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Never had a complaint before.<|endoftext|>
|0| Isn't it going to look odd that you're staying in here with us?<|endoftext|>
|0| Odd, but not alarming. They know there's no way out of thisplace.<|endoftext|>
|1| Exactly. Whatever they might think we're doing in here, theyknow we're not going anywhere.<|endoftext|>
|1| Shall we?<|endoftext|>
|0| What about Doctor Song?<|endoftext|>
|0| She dove off a rooftop.<|endoftext|>
|1| Don't worry. She does that. Amy, Rory, open all the doors tothe swimming pool.<|endoftext|>
|1| So, we know they're everywhere. Not just a landing party, anoccupying force, and they 'have been here a very, very long time. Butnobody knows that, because no one can remember them.<|endoftext|>
|0| So what are they up to?<|endoftext|>
|1| No idea. But the good news is, we've got a secret weapon.<|endoftext|>
|0| Apollo 11's your secret weapon?<|endoftext|>
|1| No, no. It's not Apollo 11. That would be silly. It's NeilArmstrong's foot.<|endoftext|>
|0| In just a few days, mankind will set foot on the Moon forthe first time. Today, the President reaffirmed America's commitment<|endoftext|>
|0| Ready. Check.<|endoftext|>
|0| Clear.<|endoftext|>
|0| Clear.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ow!<|endoftext|>
|1| Ha. So, three months. What have we found out?<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, they are everywhere. Every state in America. Ahh.<|endoftext|>
|1| Not just America, the entire world.<|endoftext|>
|0| There's a greater concentration here, though.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ow!<|endoftext|>
|1| Are you okay?<|endoftext|>
|0| All better.<|endoftext|>
|1| Better?<|endoftext|>
|0| Turns out I was wrong. I'm not pregnant.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's up?<|endoftext|>
|0| Nothing. Really, nothing. Seriously.<|endoftext|>
|0| So you've seen them, but you don't remember them.<|endoftext|>
|0| You've seen them, too. That night at the warehouse, remember?While you were pretending to hunt us down, we saw hundreds of thosethings. We still don't know what they look like.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's like they edit themselves out of your memory as soon as youlook away. The exact second you're not looking at them, you can'tremember anything.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sometimes you feel a bit sick, though, but not always.<|endoftext|>
|0| So that's why you marked your skin.<|endoftext|>
|0| Only way we'd know if we'd had an encounter.<|endoftext|>
|0| How long have they been here?<|endoftext|>
|0| That's what we've spent the last three months trying to find out.<|endoftext|>
|0| Not easy, if you can't remember anything you discover.<|endoftext|>
|0| How long do you think?<|endoftext|>
|1| As long as there's been something in the corner of your eye, orcreaking in your house, or breathing under your bed, or voices througha wall. They've been running your lives for a very long time now, sokeep this straight in your head. We are not fighting an alien invasion,we're leading a revolution. And today, the battle begins.<|endoftext|>
|0| How?<|endoftext|>
|1| Like this.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ow!<|endoftext|>
|1| (laughs) Nanorecorder. Fuses with the cartilage in your hand.(injects himself) Ow. And it tunes itself directly to the speechcentres in your brain. It'll pick up your voice, no matter what.Telepathic connection. So, the moment you see one of the creatures, youactivate it, and describe aloud exactly what you're seeing.<|endoftext|>
|1| [OC]<|endoftext|>
|1| Because the moment you break contact, you're going to forget ithappened. The light will flash if you've left yourself a message. Youkeep checking your hand if you've had an encounter. That's the firstyou'll know about it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why didn't you tell me this before we started?<|endoftext|>
|1| I did, but even information about these creatures erases itselfover time. I couldn't refresh it because I couldn't talk to you.<|endoftext|>
|0| What? What are you staring at?<|endoftext|>
|0| Look at your hand.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why is it doing that?<|endoftext|>
|1| What does it mean if the light's flashing? What did I just tellyou?<|endoftext|>
|0| I haven't<|endoftext|>
|1| Play it.<|endoftext|>
|0| My God, how did it get in here?<|endoftext|>
|0| Keep eye contact with the creature and, when I say, turnback, and when you do, straighten my bow tie.<|endoftext|>
|0| What? What are you staring at?<|endoftext|>
|0| Look at your hand.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's a hologram, extrapolated from the photo on Amy's phone.Take a good, long look.<|endoftext|>
|1| You just saw an image of one of the creatures we're fighting.Describe it to me.<|endoftext|>
|0| I can't.<|endoftext|>
|1| No. Neither can I. You straightened my bow tie because Iplanted the idea in your head while you were looking at the creature.<|endoftext|>
|0| So they could do that to people. You could be doing stuff and notreally knowing why you're doing it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Like posthypnotic suggestion.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ruling the world with posthypnotic suggestion?<|endoftext|>
|1| Now then, a little girl in a spacesuit. They got the suit fromNASA, but where did they get the girl?<|endoftext|>
|0| It could be anywhere.<|endoftext|>
|1| Except they'd probably stay close to that warehouse, becausewhy bother doing anything else? And they'd take her from somewhere thatwould cause the least amount of attention. But you'll have to find her.I'm off to NASA.<|endoftext|>
|0| Find her? Where do we look?<|endoftext|>
|1| Children's homes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello?<|endoftext|>
|0| FBI. You must be Doctor Renfrew. Can we come in?<|endoftext|>
|0| The children are asleep.<|endoftext|>
|0| We'll be very quiet.<|endoftext|>
|0| Is there a problem?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's about a missing child.<|endoftext|>
|0| What are you. Yes, come in, please. This way. Please excusethe writing. It keeps happening. I try to clean it up.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's the kids, yeah? They did that.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, the children. It must be, yes. Anyway, my office is thisway.<|endoftext|>
|0| We nearly didn't come to this place. I understood GraystarkHall was closed in 67.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's the plan, yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| The plan?<|endoftext|>
|0| Not long now.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's 1969.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, no. We close in 67. That's the plan, yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| You misunderstood me, sir. It's 1969 now.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why are you saying that? Of course it isn't.<|endoftext|>
|0| July.<|endoftext|>
|0| My office is this way. This way.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'll check upstairs.<|endoftext|>
|0| Be careful.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy.<|endoftext|>
|0| I think we've found the place she was takenfrom.<|endoftext|>
|1| How do you know?<|endoftext|>
|0| Because those things have been here. But the whole place isdeserted.<|endoftext|>
|0| There's just one guy here and I think he'slost it.<|endoftext|>
|1| Repeated memory wipes fry your headeventually. Find out what you can, but don't hang around.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where are you?<|endoftext|>
|1| Got to go. Got company.<|endoftext|>
|1| Don't worry, I've put everything back the way I found it.Except this. There's always a bit left over, isn't there?<|endoftext|>
|0| I can see them, but I think they're asleep. Get out. Just getout!<|endoftext|>
|0| Now, one more time, sir. How the hell did you get into thecommand module?<|endoftext|>
|1| I told you. I'm on a top secret mission for the President.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, maybe if you just get President Nixon to assure us ofthat, sir, that would be swell.<|endoftext|>
|1| I sent him a message.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello. I believe it's Mister Gardner. Is that correct? Head ofSecurity?<|endoftext|>
|0| Er, yes sir. Yes, Mister President.<|endoftext|>
|0| Mister Grant, is it?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, Mister President.<|endoftext|>
|0| The hopes and dreams of millions of Americans stand here todayat Cape Kennedy, and you're the men who guard those dreams. On behalfof the American people, I thank you.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're welcome, Mister President.<|endoftext|>
|0| I understand you have a baby on the way, Mister Grant.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, Mister President.<|endoftext|>
|0| What are you hoping for, a boy or a girl?<|endoftext|>
|0| Just a healthy American, sir.<|endoftext|>
|0| A healthy American will do just nicely. Now, fellows, listen.This man, here, code name the Doctor, is doing some work for mepersonally. Could you cut him a little slack?<|endoftext|>
|0| Er, Mister President, he did break in to Apollo 11.<|endoftext|>
|1| (silent) Sorry.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, I'm sure he had a very good reason for that. But I needyou to release him now so he can get on with some very important workfor the American people. Could you do that for me?<|endoftext|>
|0| Well<|endoftext|>
|0| Son, I am your Commander in Chief.<|endoftext|>
|0| Then I guess that would be fine, Mister President.<|endoftext|>
|0| Glad to hear it.<|endoftext|>
|1| Thank you. Bye, bye.<|endoftext|>
|0| Carry on, gentlemen.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ahem. America salutes you.<|endoftext|>
|0| This place, it's been closed for years.What have you been doing?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, the child. She must be cared for. It's important. That'swhat they said.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's what who said?<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello. Who are you?<|endoftext|>
|0| No, I think she's just dreaming.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello? I saw you looking through the hatch.<|endoftext|>
|0| How? How can that be me?<|endoftext|>
|0| Who are you? I don't understand, so just tell me who you are.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm sorry. I didn't mean to shoot you. I'm glad I missed. But youkilled the Doctor. Or you're going to kill him. But who are you? Justplease tell me, because I don't understand.<|endoftext|>
|0| Please help me. Help me. Please.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's just some questions. Yes, I see.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who was that? Doctor Renfrew. Who was that?<|endoftext|>
|0| Who was who?<|endoftext|>
|0| What are you? You can tell me, because I won't remember. Youinvaded us. You're everywhere.<|endoftext|>
|0| Help me! Please. I can't see. Somebody, help me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you armed?<|endoftext|>
|0| This world is ours. We have ruled it since the wheel and thefire. We have no need of weapons.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah?<|endoftext|>
|0| Welcome to America. Amy!<|endoftext|>
|1| You have to tape everything that happens in this office. Everyword, or you won't know if you're under the influence.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, you have to give me more than this. What were you doingto Apollo 11?<|endoftext|>
|1| Thing. A clever thing. Now, no more questions. You have totrust me and nobody else.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, it's Canton. Quick, he needs us.<|endoftext|>
|0| Help me. Please, I can't. I can't see.Somebody help me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy! Amy, can you hear me? Amy, I'm going to try to blow thelock. I need you to stand back.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay, gun down. I've got it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy, we're here. Are you okay?<|endoftext|>
|0| I can't see.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where is she, Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's empty.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's dark. So dark. I don't know where I am. Please, cananybody hear me?<|endoftext|>
|0| They took this out of her. How did they do that, Doctor? Why canI still hear her?<|endoftext|>
|0| Is it a recording?<|endoftext|>
|1| Er, it defaults to live. This is current. Wherever she is rightnow, this is what she's saying.<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy, can you hear me? We're coming for you. Wherever you are,we're coming, I swear.<|endoftext|>
|1| She can't hear you. I'm so sorry. It's one way.<|endoftext|>
|0| She can always hear me, Doctor. Always. Wherever she is, and shealways knows that I am coming for her. Do you understand me? Always.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, are you out there? Can you hear me? Doctor? Oh, God.Please, please, Doctor, just get me out of this.<|endoftext|>
|0| He's coming. I'll bring him, I swear.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello? Is somebody there? I think someone has been shot. Ithink we should help. We c. I can't re. I can't remember.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay. Who and what are you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Silence, Doctor. We are the Silence.<|endoftext|>
|0| Silence, Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory, listen to that.<|endoftext|>
|0| Silence.<|endoftext|>
|0| We ran from the Silence.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Silence?<|endoftext|>
|0| And Silence will fall.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello again.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sir, you've been in there for days. What the hell have you beendoing?<|endoftext|>
|0| It doesn't matter. I need Doctor Shepherd here right now.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sir, I need to talk to Colonel Jefferson right now.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, you really don't.<|endoftext|>
|0| Er, hiya, fellows. I'm President Nixon. I want to tell you, onbehalf of the American people, how much we appreciate all of your hardwork.<|endoftext|>
|0| The target for the Apollo 11 astronauts, the Moon, atliftoff, will be at a distance of 218,096 miles away. We're just pastthe two minute mark in the countdown. T minus one minute fifty fourseconds and counting.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's an exoskeleton. Basically, life support. There's abouttwenty different kinds of alien tech in here.<|endoftext|>
|1| Who was she? Why put her in here?<|endoftext|>
|0| You put this on, you don't even need to eat. The suit processessunlight directly. It's got built in weaponry, and a communicationssystem that can hack into anything.<|endoftext|>
|1| Including the telephone network?<|endoftext|>
|0| Easily.<|endoftext|>
|1| But why phone the President?<|endoftext|>
|0| It defaults to the highest authority it can find. The littlegirl gets frightened, the most powerful man on Earth gets a phone call.The night terrors with a hotline to the White House.<|endoftext|>
|0| You won't learn anything from that envelope, you know.<|endoftext|>
|1| Purchased on earth. Perfectly ordinary stationery. Tardis blue.Summoned by a stranger who won't even show his face. That's a first,for me. How about you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Our lives are back to front. Your future's my past. Your firstsare my lasts.<|endoftext|>
|1| That's not really what I asked.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ask something else, then.<|endoftext|>
|1| What are the Silence doing, raising a child?<|endoftext|>
|0| Keeping her safe, even giving her independence.<|endoftext|>
|1| The only way to save Amy is to work out what the Silence aredoing.<|endoftext|>
|0| I know.<|endoftext|>
|1| And every single thing we learn about them brings us a stepcloser.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, Doctor, I get it. I know.<|endoftext|>
|1| Of course, it's possible she's not just any little girl.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, I'd say she's human, going by the life support software.<|endoftext|>
|1| But?<|endoftext|>
|0| She climbed out of this suit. Like she forced her way out. Shemust be incredibly strong.<|endoftext|>
|1| Incredibly strong and running away. I like her.<|endoftext|>
|0| We should be trying to find her.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, I know. But how? Anyway, I have the strangest feelingshe's going to find us.<|endoftext|>
|0| Apollo 11, this is Houston. How do you read? Over.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why does it look like a NASA spacesuit?<|endoftext|>
|1| Because that's what the Silence do. Think about it. They don'tmake anything themselves. They don't have to. They get other life formsto do it for them.<|endoftext|>
|0| So they're parasites, then.<|endoftext|>
|1| Superparasites, standing in the shadows of human history sincethe very beginning. We know they can influence human behaviour any waythey want. If they've been doing that on a global scale for thousandsof years.<|endoftext|>
|0| Then what?<|endoftext|>
|1| Then why did the human race suddenly decide to go to the Moon?<|endoftext|>
|0| Ten, nine. Ignition sequence start. six, five, four<|endoftext|>
|1| Because the Silence needed a spacesuit.<|endoftext|>
|0| One, zero. All engines running. Liftoff. We have a liftoff.Thirty two minutes past the hour, liftoff on Apollo 11.<|endoftext|>
|0| My God. What is it?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's just an alien, Doctor Shepherd.<|endoftext|>
|0| Someone's already been treating it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, you've been treating it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Does Colonel Jefferson know this thing is here?<|endoftext|>
|0| No.<|endoftext|>
|0| Then I'm going to tell him right now.<|endoftext|>
|0| Again.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry, what?<|endoftext|>
|0| Exactly.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sergeant, why was I called in here for no reason?<|endoftext|>
|0| You tend to my wounds. You are foolish.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why? What would you do in my place?<|endoftext|>
|0| We have ruled your lives since your lives began. You shouldkill us all on sight, but you will never remember we were even here.You will evolve.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah? Well, sorry to disappoint you, but thanks. That's exactlywhat I needed to hear. This is a videophone. Whatever a videophone is.<|endoftext|>
|0| You should kill us all on sight.<|endoftext|>
|0| Help me, Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| This suit, it seems to be repairing itself. How's it doing that?Doctor, a unit like this, would it ever be able to move without anoccupant?<|endoftext|>
|1| Why?<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, the little girl said the spaceman was coming to eat her.Maybe that's exactly what happened.<|endoftext|>
|0| I love you. I know you think it's him. I know you think itought to be him, but it's not. It's you. And when I see you again, I'mgoing to tell you properly, just to see your stupid face. My life wasso boring before you just dropped out of the sky. So just get yourstupid face where I can see it, okay? Okay?<|endoftext|>
|1| She'll be safe for now. No point in a dead hostage.<|endoftext|>
|0| Can't you save her?<|endoftext|>
|1| I can track that signal back. Take us right to her.<|endoftext|>
|0| Then why haven't you?<|endoftext|>
|1| Because then what? I find her and then what do I do? This isn'tan alien invasion. They live here. This is their empire. This iskicking the Romans out of Rome.<|endoftext|>
|0| Rome fell.<|endoftext|>
|1| I know. I was there.<|endoftext|>
|0| So was I.<|endoftext|>
|1| Personal question.<|endoftext|>
|0| Seriously, you?<|endoftext|>
|1| Do you ever remember it? Two thousand years, waiting for Amy?The last Centurion.<|endoftext|>
|0| No.<|endoftext|>
|1| You're lying.<|endoftext|>
|0| Of course I'm lying.<|endoftext|>
|1| Of course you are. Not the sort of thing anyone forgets.<|endoftext|>
|0| But I don't remember it all the time. It's like this door in myhead. I can keep it shut.<|endoftext|>
|0| Please, please, just come and get me. Come and get me.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Flight Controller's going to go for landing. Just fivedays since Apollo 11 blasted off from Cape Kennedy, this unprecedentedjourney is reaching its crucial moment. Armstrong and Aldrin are makingtheir descent to the surface of the Moon.<|endoftext|>
|0| We copy you on the ground. You got a bunch of guys about toturn blue.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where am I? Where is this?<|endoftext|>
|0| You are Amelia Pond.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're ugly. Has anyone mentioned that to you?<|endoftext|>
|0| We do you honour. You will bring the Silence. But your partwill soon be over.<|endoftext|>
|0| Whatever that means, you've made a big mistake, bringing me here,because wait until you see what's coming for you now.<|endoftext|>
|0| You have been here many days.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, I just got here. You just put me in here.<|endoftext|>
|0| Your memory is weak. You have been here many days.<|endoftext|>
|0| No. No, I can't have been.<|endoftext|>
|0| You will sleep now. Sleep.<|endoftext|>
|0| No.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sleep.<|endoftext|>
|0| No. Get off me. No. No.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sleep.<|endoftext|>
|0| No!<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, interesting. Very Aickman Road. I've seen one of thesebefore. Abandoned. I wonder how that happened? Oh, well I suppose I'mabout to find out. Rory, River, keep one Silent in eyeshot at alltimes. Oh, hello. Sorry, you were in the middle of something. I justhad to say, though, have you seen what's on the telly? Oh, hello, Amy.Are you all right? Want to watch some television? Ah. Now, stay whereyou are. Because look at me, I'm confident. You want to watch that, me,when I'm confident. Oh, and this is my friend River. Nice hair, clever,has her own gun, and unlike me, she really doesn't mind shootingpeople. I shouldn't like that. Kind of do, a bit.<|endoftext|>
|0| Thank you, sweetie.<|endoftext|>
|1| I know you're team players and everything, but she'lldefinitely kill at least the first three of you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, the first seven, easily.<|endoftext|>
|1| Seven? Really?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, eight for you, honey.<|endoftext|>
|1| Stop it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Make me.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah? Well, maybe I will.<|endoftext|>
|0| Is this really important flirting? Because I feel like I should behigher on the list right now.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes. Right. Sorry. As I was saying, my naughty friend here isgoing to kill the first three of you to attack, plus him behind, somaybe you want to draw lots or have a quiz.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's he got?<|endoftext|>
|0| Something, I hope.<|endoftext|>
|1| Or maybe you could just listen a minute. Because all I reallywant to do is accept your total surrender and then I'll let you go inpeace. Yes, you've been interfering in human history for thousands ofyears. Yes, people have suffered and died, but what's the point in twohearts, if you can't be a bit forgiving, now and then? Ooo, theSilence. You guys take that seriously, don't you? Okay, you got me. I'mlying. I'm not really going to let you go that easily. Nice thought,but it's not Christmas. First, you tell me about the girl. Who is she?Why is she important? What's she for?<|endoftext|>
|0| And we're getting a picture on the TV.<|endoftext|>
|1| Guys, sorry, but you're way out of time. Now, come on. A bit ofhistory for you. Aren't you proud? Because you helped. Now, do you knowhow many people are watching this live on the telly? Half a billion.And that's nothing, because the human race will spread out among thestars. You just watch them fly. Billions and billions of them, forbillions and billions of years, and every single one of them at somepoint in their lives, will look back at this man,taking that very first step, and they will never, ever forget it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, engine stop. ATA on the descent. Modes control bothauto. Descent engine command off. <|endoftext|>
|1| Oh. But don't forget this bit. Ready?<|endoftext|>
|0| Ready.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's one small step for a man<|endoftext|>
|0| You should kill us all on sight. You should kill usall on sight. You should kill us all on sight. You should kill us allon sight.<|endoftext|>
|1| You've given the order for your own execution, and the wholeplanet just heard you.<|endoftext|>
|0| You should kill us all on sight.<|endoftext|>
|0| One giant leap for mankind.<|endoftext|>
|1| And one whacking great kick up the backside for the Silence.You just raised an army against yourself and now, for a thousandgenerations, you're going to be ordering them to destroy you every day.How fast can you run? Because today's the day the human race throw youoff their planet. They won't even know they're doing it. I think, quitepossibly, the word you're looking for right now is oops. Run! Guys, Imean us. Run.<|endoftext|>
|0| I can't get her out!<|endoftext|>
|0| Go. Go.<|endoftext|>
|0| We are not leaving without you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Look, will you just get your stupid face out of here.<|endoftext|>
|0| Run! Into the Tardis, quickly.<|endoftext|>
|1| Don't let them build to full power.<|endoftext|>
|0| I know. There's a reason why I'm shooting, honey. What are youdoing?<|endoftext|>
|1| Helping.<|endoftext|>
|0| You've got a screwdriver. Go build a cabinet.<|endoftext|>
|1| That's really rude.<|endoftext|>
|0| Learn how to drive.<|endoftext|>
|0| My old fellow didn't see that, did he? He gets ever so cross.<|endoftext|>
|0| So, what kind of doctor are you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Archaeology. Love a tomb.<|endoftext|>
|1| You can let me fly it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, or we could go where we're supposed to.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's the matter with you?<|endoftext|>
|0| You called me stupid.<|endoftext|>
|0| I always call you stupid.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, but my face.<|endoftext|>
|0| I wasn't sure who you were talking about. You know, me or<|endoftext|>
|0| Him?<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, you did say dropped out of the sky.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's a figure of speech, moron.<|endoftext|>
|0| Thanks.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're welcome.<|endoftext|>
|0| So we're safe again.<|endoftext|>
|1| Safe? No, of course you're not safe. There's about a billionother things out there just waiting to burn your whole world. But, ifyou want to pretend you're safe, just so you can sleep at night? Okay,you're safe. But you're not really. Canton. Until the next one, eh?<|endoftext|>
|0| Looking forward to it.<|endoftext|>
|1| Canton just wants to get married. Hell of a reason to kick himout of the FBI.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm sure something can be arranged.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm counting on you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Er, Doctor. Canton here tells me you're, you're from the future.It hardly seems possible, but I was wondering<|endoftext|>
|1| I should warn you I don't answer a lot of questions.<|endoftext|>
|0| But I'm a President at the beginning of his time. Dare I ask.Will I be remembered?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, Dicky. Tricky Dicky. They're never going to forget you. Sayhi to David Frost for me.<|endoftext|>
|0| David Frost?<|endoftext|>
|0| This person you want to marry. Black?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hmm. I know what people think of me, but perhaps I'm a littlemore liberal.<|endoftext|>
|0| He is.<|endoftext|>
|0| I think the Moon is far enough, for now, don't you, MisterDelaware?<|endoftext|>
|0| I figured it might be.<|endoftext|>
|1| You could come with us.<|endoftext|>
|0| I escape often enough, thank you. And I have a promise to liveup to. You'll understand soon enough.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay. Up to you. See you next time. Call me.<|endoftext|>
|0| What, that's it? What's the matter with you?<|endoftext|>
|1| Have I forgotten something?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, shut up.<|endoftext|>
|1| Right. Okay. Interesting.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's wrong? You're acting like we've never done that before.<|endoftext|>
|1| We haven't.<|endoftext|>
|0| We haven't?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, look at the time. Must be off. But it was very nice. Itwas, it was good. It was er, unexpected. You know what they say.There's a first time for everything.<|endoftext|>
|0| And a last time.<|endoftext|>
|1| Rory, I'm going to need thermocouplings.The green ones and blue ones.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, hold on.<|endoftext|>
|1| So.<|endoftext|>
|0| So.<|endoftext|>
|1| You're okay?<|endoftext|>
|0| Fine. Head's a bit weird. There's loads of stuff I can't quiteremember.<|endoftext|>
|1| After effect of the Silence. Natural enough. That's not what Iwas asking. You told me you were pregnant.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|1| Why?<|endoftext|>
|0| Because I was. I mean, I thought I was. It turns out I wasn't.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, why did you tell me?<|endoftext|>
|0| Because you're my friend. You're my best friend.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hmm. Did you tell Rory?<|endoftext|>
|0| No.<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy, why tell me and not Rory?<|endoftext|>
|0| Why do you think? I travelled with you in thisTardis for so long. All that time. If I was pregnant for some of it,wouldn't it have had an effect?<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't want to tell Rory his baby mighthave three heads or, like, a timehead, or something.<|endoftext|>
|1| What's a timehead?<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't know, but what if it had one?<|endoftext|>
|1| A timehead.<|endoftext|>
|0| Shut up.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oi, stupid face.<|endoftext|>
|0| Er, yeah?<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm taking that away from you, if you're going to listen in allthe time.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, that's a fair point. But you should've told me that youthought you were pregnant. I'm a nurse. I'm good with pregnancy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Not, as it turns out, that good. So please stop being stupid.<|endoftext|>
|0| Er, no, never. I'm never, ever, going to stop being stupid.<|endoftext|>
|1| So, this little girl. It's all about her. Who was she? Or wecould just go off and have some adventures. Anyone in the mood foradventures? Because I am. You only live once.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you okay? Little girl, are you okay?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's all right. It's quite all right. I'm dying. But I can fixthat. It's easy, really. See?<|endoftext|>
|0| What's wrong?<|endoftext|>
|0| Man wounded.<|endoftext|>
|0| Wake him.<|endoftext|>
|0| He slipped in the bilge water, Cap'n and fell on to therigger. His hand. I Don't know if he'll survive.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're a dead man, McGrath.<|endoftext|>
|0| Same as all the others.<|endoftext|>
|0| She's here.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, save our souls.<|endoftext|>
|0| I've got to escape!<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't go out there! McGrath, don't listen, for God's sake.The siren is a-calling.<|endoftext|>
|0| Same as all the others. No sign of a struggle, no bones orblood.<|endoftext|>
|0| We're shark bait, every single one of us. Stuck on theocean, waiting.<|endoftext|>
|0| Until the wind changes.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's that?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's the creature. It's returned.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yo ho ho! Or does nobody actually say that?<|endoftext|>
|0| We made no signal.<|endoftext|>
|1| Our sensors picked you up. Ship in distress.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sensors?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes. Okay, problem word. Seventeenth century. My shipautomatically, er, noticed-ish that your ship was having some bother.<|endoftext|>
|0| That big blue crate?<|endoftext|>
|0| That is more magic, Captain Avery. They're spirits. How elsewould they have found their way below decks?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, er, I want to say multidimensional engineering, but sinceyou had a problem with sensors, I won't go there. Look, I'm the Doctor.This is Amy, Rory. We're sailors, same as you. Ooo ar. Except for thegun thing. And the beardiness.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're stowaways. Only explanation. Eight days, we've beenstranded here, becalmed. You must have stowed away before we sailed.<|endoftext|>
|0| Now what do we do with 'em?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, I think they deserve our hospitality.<|endoftext|>
|1| I suppose that laughing like that is in the job description.Can you do the laugh? Check. Grab yourself a parrot. Welcome aboard.<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory? A little help?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah. Hey, listen, right? She's not a doxy.<|endoftext|>
|0| I didn't mean just tell him off. Thanks anyway.<|endoftext|>
|0| If you're lucky you'll drown before the sharks can take a bite.<|endoftext|>
|1| If this is just because I'm a captain too, you know, youshouldn't feel threatened. Your ship is much bigger than mine. And Idon't have the cool boots. Or a hat, even.<|endoftext|>
|0| Time to go.<|endoftext|>
|1| A bit more laughter, guys?<|endoftext|>
|1| Where are the rest of the crew? This is a big ship. Big forfive of you. I suppose the rest of them are hiding some place, andthey're going to jump out and shout boo.<|endoftext|>
|0| Boo!<|endoftext|>
|0| Throw the gun down.<|endoftext|>
|0| The rest of you, on your knees.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy, what are you doing?<|endoftext|>
|0| Saving your life. Okay with that, are you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Put down the sword. A sword could kill us all, girl.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, thanks. That is actually why I'm pointing it at you.<|endoftext|>
|0| You have killed me.<|endoftext|>
|0| No way. It's just a cut.<|endoftext|>
|0| What kind of rubbish pirates are you?<|endoftext|>
|0| One drop, that's all it takes. One drop of blood and she'll riseout of the ocean.<|endoftext|>
|0| Come on, I barely even scratched him. What are you all in such ahuff about?<|endoftext|>
|0| Ow! Argh!<|endoftext|>
|0| Er, Doctor, what's happening to me?<|endoftext|>
|0| She can smell the blood on your skin. She's marked you fordeath.<|endoftext|>
|0| She?<|endoftext|>
|0| A demon, out there in the ocean.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay. Groovy. So not just pirates today. We've managed to bagsya ship where there's a demon popping in. Very efficient. I mean, ifsomething's going to kill you, it's nice that it drops you a note toremind you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Quickly now, block out the sound.<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|0| The creature. She charms all her victims with that song.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, great. So put my fingers in my ears, that's your plan?Doctor, come on. Let's go. Let's get back to the er, back to the er<|endoftext|>
|0| The music. It's working on him. Look.<|endoftext|>
|0| You are so beautiful.<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|0| I love your get up. That's great. You should dress as a piratemore often. Hey, hey, cuddle me, shipmate.<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory, stop.<|endoftext|>
|0| Everything is totally brilliant, isn't it? Look at thesebrilliant pirates. Look at their brilliant beards. I'd like a beard.I'm going to grow a beard.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're not.<|endoftext|>
|0| The music turns them into fools.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, my God.<|endoftext|>
|0| I have to touch her. Let me touch her.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry, but he is spoken for.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy! Everybody into the hold. Rory! Come on!<|endoftext|>
|0| Hey! Wait!<|endoftext|>
|0| What is that thing?<|endoftext|>
|0| The legend. The siren. Many a merchant ship laden with treasurehas fallen prey to her. She's been hunting us ever since we werebecalmed, picking off the injured.<|endoftext|>
|0| Like a shark. A shark can smell blood.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay. Just like a shark, in a dress. And singing. And green? Agreen singing shark in an evening gown.<|endoftext|>
|0| The ship is cursed!<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, right. Cursed is big with humans. It means bad things arehappening but you can't be bothered to find an explanation.<|endoftext|>
|0| She's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.<|endoftext|>
|0| Actually, I think you'll find she isn't.<|endoftext|>
|0| She is.<|endoftext|>
|0| We have to leave right now.<|endoftext|>
|0| That thing of yours really is a ship?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, it's not propelled by the wind.<|endoftext|>
|0| Show me. Weigh anchor. Make it sail.<|endoftext|>
|1| And the gun's back. You're big on the gun thing, aren't you.Freud would say you're compensating. Ever met Freud? No? Comfy sofa.<|endoftext|>
|0| Leave the cursed one, Captain. The creature can have him.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, please.<|endoftext|>
|0| We don't want the siren coming after us.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's a leech!<|endoftext|>
|1| Everyone out of the water!<|endoftext|>
|0| It's bitten me. I'm bleeding.<|endoftext|>
|1| She wants blood. Why does she want blood?<|endoftext|>
|0| What were you saying about leaving the cursed ones behind?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's okay, we're safe down here. No curse is getting throughthree solid inches of timber.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh! Ah. Hello again.<|endoftext|>
|0| No! No! No!<|endoftext|>
|0| Safe?<|endoftext|>
|1| I have my good days and my bad days.<|endoftext|>
|0| How did she get in?<|endoftext|>
|1| Bilge water. She's using water like a portal, a door. She canmaterialise through a single drop. We need to go somewhere with nowater.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, thank God we're not in the middle of the ocean.<|endoftext|>
|0| Did you see her eyes? Like crystal pools.<|endoftext|>
|0| You are in enough trouble.<|endoftext|>
|0| The magazine.<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|1| He means the armoury where the powder's stored.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's dry as a bone.<|endoftext|>
|1| Good. Let's go there.<|endoftext|>
|0| I give the orders.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah. Worried because I'm wearing a hat now? Nobody touchanything sharp!<|endoftext|>
|0| Come on, Rory.<|endoftext|>
|0| Quickly, man.<|endoftext|>
|0| I can't find the key. Tis gone, Cap'n.<|endoftext|>
|0| How can it have gone?<|endoftext|>
|1| Someone else had the same idea.<|endoftext|>
|0| Barricade the door. Careful of that lantern.Every barrel is full of powder.<|endoftext|>
|1| Who's been sleeping in my gun room?<|endoftext|>
|0| You fool! You fool, boy. What are you doing here?<|endoftext|>
|1| Who is he? What, he's not one of the crew?<|endoftext|>
|0| No. He's my son. What in God's name possessed you, boy? Yourmother will be searching for you. When?<|endoftext|>
|0| Last winter. Fever. She told me all about you. How you were aCaptain in the Navy. An honourable man, she said. How I'd be proud toknow you. I've come to join your crew.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't want you here.<|endoftext|>
|0| You can't send me back. It's too late. We're a hundred miles fromhome.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's dangerous here. There is a monster aboard. She leaves amark on men's skin.<|endoftext|>
|0| The black spot?<|endoftext|>
|0| There's nothing wrong with the boy. He has no scars.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yep. Ignore my last theory.<|endoftext|>
|0| He has his good days and his bad days.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's not just blood, she's coming for all the sick and wounded,like a hunter chooses the weakest animal.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, look, he's got a fever. The siren knows it.<|endoftext|>
|1| Humans. Second-rate. Damage too easily. It's only a matter oftime before everyone gets bruised. My ship, it can sail us all awayfrom here. You and me, we fetch it. Let's go.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're not the Captain here, remember.<|endoftext|>
|0| The water's dangerous. That's how she gets through. One touch ofher hand and you're a dead man.<|endoftext|>
|0| We're all cursed if we stay aboard.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's not a curse. Curse means game over. Curse means we'rehelpless. We are not helpless. Captain, what's our next move?<|endoftext|>
|0| Wait with the boy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Captain, we're all in danger here.<|endoftext|>
|0| I said wait. And barricade the door after we've gone.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sure you want to go?<|endoftext|>
|1| We have to get Rory and Toby away. She's out there now, lickingher lips, boiling a saucepan, grating cheese.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay. Well, remember, if you get an itch, don't scratch too hard.<|endoftext|>
|1| We've all got to go some time. There are worse ways than havingyour face snogged off by a dodgy mermaid.<|endoftext|>
|0| Do you want to draw lots for who's incharge, then?<|endoftext|>
|1| Darkness? Demon? You can have first go.<|endoftext|>
|0| Nearly. Phew!<|endoftext|>
|0| By all the<|endoftext|>
|1| Let me stop you there. Bigger on the inside. Don't mind, doyou, if we just skip to the end of that moment? Oh, and sorry I lied,by the way, when I said yours was bigger. Kitchen that way. Choice ofbathrooms there, there, there.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's wrong?<|endoftext|>
|0| The most beautiful thing you've ever seen?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, tell me I didn't really say that.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's going on?<|endoftext|>
|0| We're not staying here to mollycoddle the boy. The Captain'sgone soft. It's time for us to leave.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's this do?<|endoftext|>
|1| That does very, very complicated. That does sophisticated. Thatdoes whoa, amazing, And that does whizz, bang, far too technical toexplain!<|endoftext|>
|0| Wheel?<|endoftext|>
|1| Atom accelerator.<|endoftext|>
|0| It steers the thing.<|endoftext|>
|1| No. Sort of. Yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Wheel. Telescope. Astrolabe. Compass. A ship's a ship.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh.<|endoftext|>
|0| He told you to wait, you dog. He's yourCaptain, a Naval Officer. You're honour-bound to do as he tells you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Honour-bound? Do you know what kind of ship this is? Do youknow what your father does?<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't listen to him, Toby.<|endoftext|>
|0| We sail under the black flag. The Jolly Roger.<|endoftext|>
|0| Liar! He's no wicked pirate!<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, you think so? I have seen your father gun down athousand innocent men.<|endoftext|>
|1| This is how the professionals do it.<|endoftext|>
|1| Er, it's stuck. Not responding.<|endoftext|>
|0| Becalmed?<|endoftext|>
|1| Mmm hmm. Yeah, apparently. That's new. You had to gloat, didn'tyou?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm not gloating.<|endoftext|>
|1| I saw that look just now. Ha, ha, his ship is rubbish.<|endoftext|>
|0| True.<|endoftext|>
|0| Get what treasure you can. I'll meet youin the row boat.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're going to remain at your post.<|endoftext|>
|0| I am not playing games with you, boy. You put that down.<|endoftext|>
|0| One more step and I'll use this, you blaggard.<|endoftext|>
|0| You don't know how to fight with a cutlass, boy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't need to, do I.<|endoftext|>
|0| No<|endoftext|>
|1| It can't get a lock on the plane.<|endoftext|>
|0| The what?<|endoftext|>
|1| The space we travel in. The ocean. Sort of ocean but not water.The Tardis can't see. It's sulking because it thinks the space doesn'texist. Without a plane to lock onto we're not going anywhere.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm confused.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, well, it's a big club. We should get T-shirts.<|endoftext|>
|1| What's happening?<|endoftext|>
|0| You little swabber!<|endoftext|>
|0| Congratulations. You made it to the menu. Probably shouldn't goout there now.<|endoftext|>
|0| You scurvy ape!<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't shoot. The powder will blow and kill us all.<|endoftext|>
|0| Mulligan, what are you doing?<|endoftext|>
|0| No honour among pirates.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay, she's had her little sulk. Now she'sheading for the full-on screaming tantrum.<|endoftext|>
|0| Can you fix it?<|endoftext|>
|1| Argh! The parametric engines are jammed. Orthogonal vector'sgone. I'm almost out of ideas.<|endoftext|>
|0| Almost?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, we could try stroking her and singing her a song.<|endoftext|>
|0| Will that help?<|endoftext|>
|1| Hard to say. Never has before. I've lost control of her. She'sabout to dematerialise. We could end up anywhere!<|endoftext|>
|0| That sounds bad!<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, it is! Out! Out now! Abandon ship! Abandon ship!<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay, okay, okay. Tardis runs off on its own. That's a bit of anew one. Bang goes our only hope of getting them out of here.<|endoftext|>
|0| Not much of a Captain without a ship, are you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Mulligan, what are you doing? This is mutiny.<|endoftext|>
|0| She doesn't want me. She only wants Toby and the scrawnylooking fellow.<|endoftext|>
|1| He's got the last of the supplies. We should go after him.<|endoftext|>
|0| Never mind the damned supplies. What about my treasure?<|endoftext|>
|1| Don't get injured. Don't get injured.<|endoftext|>
|0| Come out of there, you mutinous dog!<|endoftext|>
|1| She's inside.<|endoftext|>
|0| She's come for Mulligan.<|endoftext|>
|0| Argh!<|endoftext|>
|0| No water in here. How did she take him? Yousaid she uses water like a door, that's how she enters a room.<|endoftext|>
|1| I was wrong. Please ignore all my theories up to this point.<|endoftext|>
|0| What, again?<|endoftext|>
|1| We're all in danger. The water's not how she's getting in. Whenwe were down in the hold, think what happened. You, me, Amy, Rory,leeches.<|endoftext|>
|0| She sprang from the water.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, only when it grew still. Still water. Nature's mirror.<|endoftext|>
|0| So, you mean<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes. Not water, reflection.<|endoftext|>
|1| That siren legend. The curse.<|endoftext|>
|0| You said curses weren't real.<|endoftext|>
|1| Folklore springs from truth. She attacks ships filled withtreasure. Where else do you get a perfect reflection?<|endoftext|>
|0| Polished metal.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hmm.<|endoftext|>
|0| We must warn them.<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy! Open the door!<|endoftext|>
|0| Toby, open the door! Toby!<|endoftext|>
|0| Open the door.<|endoftext|>
|0| Toby!<|endoftext|>
|1| We've got to destroy every reflection. Gold, silver, glass, shecould spring from any of them. Oh, yes, yes, I know, I know. Very badluck to break it. But look at it this way. There's a stroppy homicidalmermaid trying to kill all.<|endoftext|>
|0| How much worse can things get?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yep. Help me lug this lot out.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where are we taking it?<|endoftext|>
|0| No! No. This is the treasure of the Mogul of India.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, good. For a moment there I thought it was yours.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, no. Doctor, wait. Must we do this?<|endoftext|>
|1| Any reflection, any mirror, and the siren will attack. We haveto protect Rory and Toby. Go and get the crown from the storeroom.<|endoftext|>
|0| Just wait?<|endoftext|>
|1| Not my most dynamic plan, I realise.<|endoftext|>
|0| Tardis?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's been towed.<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|1| Sorry. We might be stuck here for a while.<|endoftext|>
|0| So you're saying that we should all just wait here below?<|endoftext|>
|0| The sea is still calm, like a mirror. If you go out on deckshe'll rise up and attack you.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's okay. The calm won't last forever. When the wind picks upwe'll all set sail.<|endoftext|>
|0| Until it does, you have to hide down here.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm sorry about your mother. You miss her a lot.<|endoftext|>
|0| Three years. No word from you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Toby.<|endoftext|>
|0| You promised her. You promised you'd come home. And she believedyou would, right up until the day she died. What made you do it? Whatmade you turn pirate?<|endoftext|>
|0| Get some sleep now.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's fine. You're doing fine. Just stay calm.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's not one star, it's two. The Dog star,Sirius. Binary system.<|endoftext|>
|0| I use it to navigate the ocean.<|endoftext|>
|1| I've travelled far, like you. Space can be very lonely, and thegreatest adventure is having someone share it with you.<|endoftext|>
|0| If we get out of this I'll take him back to England. He can'tstay with me. I'm not the father he needs.<|endoftext|>
|1| Who are you, Henry Avery? Respected naval officer, wife andchild at home. How did you end up here, wandering the oceans with aband of rogues?<|endoftext|>
|0| I've set my course now. Nothing I can do to alter it.<|endoftext|>
|1| People stared at it for centuries and never knew. Things cansuddenly change, when you're least expecting.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|1| Shush.<|endoftext|>
|0| What can you see?<|endoftext|>
|1| Feels like something's out there, staring straight at me.<|endoftext|>
|1| Man the sails!<|endoftext|>
|0| To the rigging, you dogs! Let go the sails. Avast ye! Put thebunt into the slack of the clews.<|endoftext|>
|0| I swear he's making half this stuff up.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, we're going to need some kind of phrase book.<|endoftext|>
|0| Toby! Find my coat. My compass is inside it, boy. Heave ho, youbilge rats.<|endoftext|>
|0| Rats was all I could hear.<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't let her take you!<|endoftext|>
|0| No!<|endoftext|>
|0| No!<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm sorry, I'm sorry.<|endoftext|>
|1| You couldn't give up the gold, could you. That's why you turnedpirate. Your commission, your wife, your son. Just how much is thattreasure worth to you, man?<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory! Rory! I can't see him. Doctor? I'm going in.<|endoftext|>
|1| He's drowning. He's drowning! You go in after him, you'll drowntoo. There's only one thing that can save him now.<|endoftext|>
|0| What are you talking about?<|endoftext|>
|1| The Siren. The Siren, she wants him. We have to release her.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, no.<|endoftext|>
|1| He's drowning. Go and find him!<|endoftext|>
|0| What, what did you do?<|endoftext|>
|1| If he stays in there he'll die.<|endoftext|>
|0| But she'll destroy him.<|endoftext|>
|1| That thing isn't just a ravenous hunter. It's intelligent. Wecan reason with it. And maybe, just maybe, they're still alivesomewhere. We have to follow.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you mad?<|endoftext|>
|1| If we ever want to see them again, we have to let the Sirentake us. We'll prick our fingers. All agreed? Yeah?<|endoftext|>
|0| Aye.<|endoftext|>
|0| Aye.<|endoftext|>
|1| Aye.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where are we?<|endoftext|>
|1| We haven't moved. We're in exactly the same place as before.<|endoftext|>
|0| We're on a ghost ship.<|endoftext|>
|1| No. It's real. Space ship trapped in a temporal rift.<|endoftext|>
|0| How can two ships be in the same place?<|endoftext|>
|1| Not the same. Two planes, two worlds, two cars parked in thesame space. There are lots of different universes nested inside eachother. Now and again they collide, and you can step from one to theother.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, I think I understand.<|endoftext|>
|1| Good, because it's not like that at all. But if that helps.<|endoftext|>
|0| Thanks.<|endoftext|>
|1| All the reflections have suddenly become gateways.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ever look in a mirror and think you're seeing a whole otherworld? Well, this time it's not an illusion.<|endoftext|>
|0| The signal.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| The distress call.<|endoftext|>
|1| Uh huh.<|endoftext|>
|0| There was a second ship here all the time.<|endoftext|>
|1| And the Siren is on board.<|endoftext|>
|1| Dead.<|endoftext|>
|0| You were right. There was something staring at us the whole time.How long has this ship been marooned here?<|endoftext|>
|0| Long enough for the Captain to have run out of grog.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't understand. If this is the Captain, then what's the Siren?<|endoftext|>
|1| Same as us. A stowaway.<|endoftext|>
|0| She killed it?<|endoftext|>
|1| Human bacteria.<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|1| A virus from our planet. Airborne, travelling through theportal. That's what killed it. Didn't get its jabs. Urgh. Look.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is it?<|endoftext|>
|1| Sneeze! Alien bogies.<|endoftext|>
|0| McGrath! He's one of my men.<|endoftext|>
|0| He's still breathing.<|endoftext|>
|0| My entire crew is here. Toby!<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory!<|endoftext|>
|1| The Tardis!<|endoftext|>
|0| We have to get them out of here.<|endoftext|>
|1| Wait. His fever's gone.<|endoftext|>
|0| He looks so well.<|endoftext|>
|1| She's keeping him alive. His brain is still active, but all itscellular activity is suspended. It's not a curse, it's a tissue sample.Why get samples of people you are about to kill?<|endoftext|>
|0| Help me get him up.<|endoftext|>
|1| She's coming.<|endoftext|>
|1| Anaesthetic.<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|1| The music. The song. So she anaesthetises people and puts theirbody in stasis.<|endoftext|>
|1| Avery, no!<|endoftext|>
|1| Fire. That's new. What does fire do? Burn? Yes. Destroy? Whatelse? Sterilise! I sneezed. I've brought germs in.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy, stop. Don't interfere. Don't touch him. Anaesthetic,tissue sample, screen, sterile working conditions. Ignore all myprevious theories!<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah? Well, we stopped paying attention a while back.<|endoftext|>
|1| She's not a killer at all, she's a doctor!<|endoftext|>
|1| This is an automated sick bay. It's teleporting everyone onboard. The crew are dead, and so the sick bay has had nothing to do.It's been looking after humanity whilst it's been idle. Look at her. Avirtual doctor able to sterilise a whole room.<|endoftext|>
|0| Able to burn your face off.<|endoftext|>
|1| She's just an interface, seeped through the join between theplanes, broadcast in our world. Protean circuitry means she can changeher form, and become a human doctor for humans. Oh, sister, you aregood.<|endoftext|>
|0| She won't let us take them.<|endoftext|>
|1| She's keeping them alive, but she doesn't know how to healthem.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm his wife, for God's sake. Why can't I touch him?<|endoftext|>
|1| Tell her, Amy. Show her your ring. She may be virtual but she'sintelligent. You can't do anything without her consent. Come on.Sophisticated girl like you. That must be somewhere in your coreprogram.<|endoftext|>
|0| Look, he's very ill, okay? I just want to look after him. Whywon't you let me near my husband?<|endoftext|>
|1| Consent form. Sign it. Put your hand in the light. Rory's sick.You have to take full responsibility.<|endoftext|>
|1| He can't breathe. Turn it back on.<|endoftext|>
|0| What do we do? I can't just leave him here.<|endoftext|>
|0| He'll die if you take him out.<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory? Rory, wake up.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where am I?<|endoftext|>
|1| You're in a hospital. If you leave, you might die.<|endoftext|>
|0| But if you don't, you'll have to stay forever.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're saying that if I don't get up now<|endoftext|>
|0| You can never leave.<|endoftext|>
|1| The Siren will keep you safe.<|endoftext|>
|0| And if I come with you?<|endoftext|>
|1| Drowning, on the point of death.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm a nurse.<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|0| I can teach you how to save me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Whoa. Hold on.<|endoftext|>
|0| I was drowning. You just have to resuscitate me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Just?<|endoftext|>
|0| You've seen them do it loads of times in films. CPR. The kiss oflife.<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory, this isn't a film, okay? What if I do it wrong?<|endoftext|>
|0| You won't.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, what if you don't come back to life? What if<|endoftext|>
|0| I trust you.<|endoftext|>
|0| What about him? I mean, why do I have to be the one? Why do I haveto save you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Because I know you'll never give up.<|endoftext|>
|1| We have to send this ship back into space. Imagine if the Sirengot ashore. She would have to process every injured human.<|endoftext|>
|0| What about Toby?<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm sorry. Typhoid fever. Once he returns it's only a matter oftime.<|endoftext|>
|0| What if I stay with him, here. The Siren will look after him. Ican't go back to England. And what home does he have now, if not withme?<|endoftext|>
|1| Do you think you can sail this thing?<|endoftext|>
|0| Just point me to the atom accelerator.<|endoftext|>
|0| I know you can do this. Of course, if you muck it up I am goingto be really cross. And dead.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'll see you in a minute.<|endoftext|>
|1| Come on. Come on, Rory. Not here. Not this way. Not today.<|endoftext|>
|0| He trusted me. He trusted me to save him.<|endoftext|>
|1| You still can. You can still do this. He believes in you. Comeon, Amy. Come on!<|endoftext|>
|0| Please, please, please wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Come on. Comeon.<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy. Amy, you did it. You did it!<|endoftext|>
|0| I thought I was an excellent pirate.<|endoftext|>
|0| I thought you were an excellent nurse.<|endoftext|>
|0| Easy, tiger. Goodnight, Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| Goodnight, Amelia.<|endoftext|>
|0| You only call me Amelia when you're worrying about me.<|endoftext|>
|1| I always worry about you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Mutual.<|endoftext|>
|1| Go to bed, Pond.<|endoftext|>
|0| (sotto) You can't tell him. It's his future.<|endoftext|>
|0| I know.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, Amelia. <|endoftext|>
|0| Will it be me, Uncle?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, it's going to be you. I only wish I could go in your place,Idris. Nah, I don't, because it's really going to hurt.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's starting. What will happen?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh. Er, Nephew will drain your mind and your soul from yourbody and leave your body empty.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm scared.<|endoftext|>
|0| I expect so, dear. But soon you'll have a new soul. There'll bea Time Lord coming.<|endoftext|>
|1| And then we discovered it wasn't the RobotKing after all, it was the real one. Fortunately, I was able tore-attach the head.<|endoftext|>
|0| Do you believe any of this stuff?<|endoftext|>
|0| I was there.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, it's the warning lights. I'm getting rid of those. Theynever stop.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hey. You're still thinking about it, aren't you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, shush. We saw him die.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, two hundred years in the future.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, but it's still going to happen.<|endoftext|>
|0| What was that?<|endoftext|>
|1| The door. It knocked.<|endoftext|>
|0| Right. We are in deep space.<|endoftext|>
|1| Very, very deep.<|endoftext|>
|1| And somebody's knocking.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, come here. Come here, you scrumptious little beauty.<|endoftext|>
|0| A box?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, what is it?<|endoftext|>
|1| I've got mail. Time Lord emergency messaging system. In anemergency, we'd wrap up thoughts in psychic containers and send themthrough time and space. Anyway, there's a living Time Lord still outthere, and it's one of the good ones.<|endoftext|>
|0| You said there weren't any other Time Lords left.<|endoftext|>
|1| There are no Time Lords left anywhere in the universe. But theuniverse isn't where we're going. See that snake?<|endoftext|>
|1| The mark of the Corsair. Fantastic bloke. He had that snake asa tattoo in every regeneration. Didn't feel like himself unless he hadthe tattoo. Or herself, a couple of times. Ooo, she was a bad girl.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, what is happening?<|endoftext|>
|1| We're leaving the universe.<|endoftext|>
|0| How can you leave the universe?<|endoftext|>
|1| With enormous difficulty. Right now I'm burning up Tardis roomsto give us some welly. Goodbye, swimming pool. Goodbye, scullery.Sayonara, squash court seven.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, okay. Where are we?<|endoftext|>
|1| Outside the universe, where we've never, ever been.<|endoftext|>
|0| Is that meant to be happening?<|endoftext|>
|1| The power, it's draining. Everything's draining. But it can't.That's, that's impossible.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is that?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's as if the Matrix, the soul of the Tardis, has justvanished. Where would it go?<|endoftext|>
|0| So what kind of trouble's your friend in?<|endoftext|>
|1| He was in a bind. A bit of a pickle. Sort of distressed.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ah, you can't just say you don't know.<|endoftext|>
|0| But what is this place? The scrap yard at the end of theuniverse?<|endoftext|>
|1| Not end of, outside of.<|endoftext|>
|0| How we can we be outside the universe? The universe iseverything.<|endoftext|>
|1| Imagine a great big soap bubble with one of those tiny littlebubbles on the outside.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, it's nothing like that. Completely drained. Look at her.<|endoftext|>
|0| Wait. So we're in a tiny bubble universe, sticking to the side ofthe bigger bubble universe?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah. No. But if it helps, yes. This place is full of riftenergy. She'll probably refuel just by being here. Now, this place.What do we think, eh? Gravity's almost Earth normal, air's breathable,but it smells like<|endoftext|>
|0| Armpits.<|endoftext|>
|1| Armpits.<|endoftext|>
|0| What about all this stuff? Where did this come from?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, there's a rift. Now and then stuff gets sucked throughit. Not a bubble, a plughole. The universe has a plughole and we'vejust fallen down it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Thief! Thief! You're my thief!<|endoftext|>
|0| She's dangerous. Guard yourselves.<|endoftext|>
|0| Look at you. Goodbye. No, not goodbye, what's the other one?<|endoftext|>
|0| Watch out. Careful. Keep back from her. Welcome, strangers.Lovely. Sorry about the mad person.<|endoftext|>
|1| Why am I a thief? What have I stolen?<|endoftext|>
|0| Me. You're going to steal me. No, you have stolen me. You arestealing me. Oh tenses are difficult, aren't they?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh. Oh, we are sorry, my dove. She's off her head. They call meAuntie.<|endoftext|>
|0| And I'm Uncle. I'm everybody's Uncle. Just keep back from thisone. She bites!<|endoftext|>
|0| Do I? Excellent.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ow! Ow!<|endoftext|>
|0| Biting's excellent. It's like kissing, only there's a winner.<|endoftext|>
|0| So sorry. She's doolally.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, I'm not doolally. I'm, I'm. It's on the tip of my tongue.I've just had a new idea about kissing. Come here, you.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, Idris, no.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, but now you're angry. No, you're not. You will be angry. Thelittle boxes will make you angry.<|endoftext|>
|1| Sorry? The little what? Boxes?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, ho, no. Your chin is hilarious. It means the smell of dustafter rain.<|endoftext|>
|0| What does?<|endoftext|>
|0| Petrichor.<|endoftext|>
|0| But I didn't ask.<|endoftext|>
|0| Not yet. But you will.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, no, Idris. I think you should have a rest.<|endoftext|>
|0| Rest. Yes, yes. Good idea. I'll just see if there's an offswitch.<|endoftext|>
|0| Is that it? She dead now. So sad.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, she's still breathing.<|endoftext|>
|0| Nephew, take Idris somewhere she can not bite people.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, hello!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, what is that?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, no, it's all right. It's an Ood. Oods are good. Love anOod. Hello, Ood. Can't you talk? Oh, I see. It's damaged. May I? Itmight just be on the wrong frequency.<|endoftext|>
|0| Nephew was broken when he came here. Why, he was half dead.House repaired him. House repaired all of us.<|endoftext|>
|0| If you are receiving this message, please help me. Send asignal to the High Council of the Time Lords on Gallifrey. Tell themthat I am still alive. I don't know where I am. I'm on some rock-likeplanet.<|endoftext|>
|0| What was that? Was that him?<|endoftext|>
|1| No, no. It's picking up something else. But that's, that's notpossible. That's, that's. Who else is here? Tell me. Show me. Show me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Just what you see. Just the four of us, and the House. Nephew,will you take Idris somewhere safe where she can't hurt nobody?<|endoftext|>
|1| The House? What's the House?<|endoftext|>
|0| House is all around you, my sweets. You are standing on him.This is the House. This world. Would you like to meet him?<|endoftext|>
|0| Meet him?<|endoftext|>
|1| I'd love to.<|endoftext|>
|0| This way. Come, please. Come.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's wrong? What were those voices?<|endoftext|>
|1| Time Lords. It's not just the Corsair. Somewhere close by thereare lots and lots of Time Lords.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm, I'm. Big word, sad word. Why is that word so sad? No. Willbe sad. Will be sad.<|endoftext|>
|0| Come. Come, come. You can see the House andhe can look at you, and he<|endoftext|>
|1| I see. This asteroid is sentient.<|endoftext|>
|0| We walk on his back, breathe his air, eat his food.<|endoftext|>
|0| Smell its armpits.<|endoftext|>
|0| And do my will. You are most welcome, travellers.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, that voice. That's the asteroid talking?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes. So you're like a sea urchin. Hard outer surface, that'sthe planet we're walking on. Big, squashy, oogly thing inside, that'syou.<|endoftext|>
|0| That is correct, Time Lord.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah. So you've met Time Lords before?<|endoftext|>
|0| Many travellers have come through the rift, like Auntie andUncle and Nephew. I repair them when they break.<|endoftext|>
|1| So there are Time Lords here, then?<|endoftext|>
|0| Not any more, but there have been many Tardises on my backin days gone by.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, there won't be any more after us. Last Time Lord. LastTardis.<|endoftext|>
|0| A pity. Your people were so kind. Be here in safety,Doctor. Rest, feed, if you will.<|endoftext|>
|0| We're not actually going to stay here, are we?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, it seems like a friendly planet. Literally. Mind if wepoke around a bit?<|endoftext|>
|0| You can look all you want. Go. Look. (to Amy) House loves you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Come on then, gang. We're just going to, er, see the sights.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are there a see zero that ito emo we. Ah!What was that? Do fish have fingers? Like a nine year old trying torebuild a motorbike. What am I saying? Why am I saying that? Thief?Where's my thief? Thief!<|endoftext|>
|0| Thief!<|endoftext|>
|1| Shush, shush, shush.<|endoftext|>
|0| So, as soon as the Tardis is refuelled, we go, yeah?<|endoftext|>
|1| No. There are Time Lords here. I heard them and they need me.<|endoftext|>
|0| You told me about your people, and you told me what you did.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, yes, but if they're like the Corsair, they're good one andI can save them.<|endoftext|>
|0| And then tell them you destroyed the others?<|endoftext|>
|1| I can explain. Tell them why I had to.<|endoftext|>
|0| You want to be forgiven.<|endoftext|>
|1| Don't we all?<|endoftext|>
|0| What do you need from me?<|endoftext|>
|1| My screwdriver. I left it in the Tardis. It's in my jacket.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're wearing your jacket.<|endoftext|>
|1| My other jacket.<|endoftext|>
|0| You have two of those?<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, I'll get it. But Doctor, listen to me. Don't get emotionalbecause that's when you make mistakes.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, boss.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'll call you from the Tardis. Rory, look after him.<|endoftext|>
|1| Rory, look after her.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah.<|endoftext|>
|0| I told you to look after him.<|endoftext|>
|0| He'll be fine. He's a Time Lord.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's just what they're called. It doesn't mean he actually knowswhat he's doing.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hey, we're here. Screwdriver's in your jacket, yeah?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, it's around somewhere. Have a goodlook.<|endoftext|>
|0| Did you do that?<|endoftext|>
|0| I didn't do anything. Right. Jacket.<|endoftext|>
|1| Come on. Where are you? Now, where are youall? Where are you?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, they can't all be in here.<|endoftext|>
|0| Please do you read me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Structural integrity failure. Damage to dimensionalstabiliser.<|endoftext|>
|0| If you can hear, come and help.<|endoftext|>
|1| Just admiring your Time Lord distress signal collection. Nicejob. Brilliant job. Really thought I had some friends here, but this iswhat the Ood translator picked up. Cries for help from the long dead.How many Time Lords have you lured here the way you lured me, and whathappened to them all?<|endoftext|>
|0| House, House is kind and he is wise.<|endoftext|>
|1| House repairs you when you break. Yes, I know. But how does hemend you? You've got the eyes of a twenty year old.<|endoftext|>
|0| Thank you.<|endoftext|>
|1| No. Oh, no, I mean it literally. Your eyes are thirty yearsyounger than the rest of you. Your ears don't match, your right arm istwo inches longer than you're left, and how's your dancing? Becauseyou've got two left feet. Patchwork people. You've been repaired andpatched up so often, I doubt there's anything left of what used to beyou. I had an umbrella like you once.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, now, it's been a great arm for me, this.<|endoftext|>
|1| Corsair.<|endoftext|>
|0| He was a strapping big bloke, wasn't he, Uncle?<|endoftext|>
|0| Big fellow.<|endoftext|>
|0| I got the arm and then Uncle got the spine and the kidneys.<|endoftext|>
|0| Kidneys.<|endoftext|>
|1| You gave me hope, and then you took it away. That's enough tomake anyone dangerous. God knows what it will do to me. Basically, run!<|endoftext|>
|0| Poor old Time Lord. Too late. House is too clever.<|endoftext|>
|0| No sonic screwdriver. Also the doors seemed tohave locked behind us. Rory thinks there's a perfectly innocentexplanation, but I think you lied to us.<|endoftext|>
|1| Time Lord stuff. Needed you out of the way.<|endoftext|>
|0| What, we're not good enough<|endoftext|>
|0| For your smart new friends?<|endoftext|>
|1| The boxes will make you angry. How could she know?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, what are you talking about?<|endoftext|>
|1| Stay put. Stay exactly where you are.<|endoftext|>
|1| How did you know about the boxes? You saidthey'd make me angry. How did you know?<|endoftext|>
|0| Ah, it's my thief.<|endoftext|>
|1| Who are you?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's about time.<|endoftext|>
|0| He's not trusting us and he's being emotional. This is bad. Thisis very, very bad.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, I think it probably is.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sometimes I hate being right.<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't understand. Who are you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Do you not know me? Just because they put me in here?<|endoftext|>
|1| They said you were dangerous.<|endoftext|>
|0| Not the cage, stupid. In here. They put me in here. I'm the. Oh,what do you call me? We travel. I go (Tardis sound)<|endoftext|>
|1| The Tardis?<|endoftext|>
|0| Time And Relative Dimension In Space. Yes, that's it. Names arefunny. It's me. I'm the Tardis.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, you're not. You're a bitey, mad lady. The Tardis is up anddowny stuff in a big blue box.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, that's me. A Type Forty Tardis. I was already a museumpiece when you were young, and the first time you touched my consoleyou said<|endoftext|>
|1| I said you were the most beautiful thing I had ever known.<|endoftext|>
|0| And then you stole me. And I stole you.<|endoftext|>
|1| I borrowed you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Borrowing implies the intention to return the thing that wastaken. What makes you think I would ever give you back?<|endoftext|>
|1| You're the Tardis?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|1| My Tardis?<|endoftext|>
|0| My Doctor. Oh. We have now reached the point in the conversationwhere you open the lock.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are all people like this?<|endoftext|>
|1| Like what?<|endoftext|>
|0| So much bigger on the inside. I'm, oh, what is that word? It'sso big, so complicated. It's so sad.<|endoftext|>
|1| But why? Why pull the living soul from a Tardis and pop it in atiny human head? What does it want you for?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, it doesn't want me.<|endoftext|>
|1| How do you know?<|endoftext|>
|0| House eats Tardises.<|endoftext|>
|1| House what? What do you mean?<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't know. It's something I heard you say.<|endoftext|>
|1| When?<|endoftext|>
|0| In the future.<|endoftext|>
|1| House eats Tardises?<|endoftext|>
|0| There you go. What are fish fingers?<|endoftext|>
|1| When do I say that?<|endoftext|>
|0| Any second.<|endoftext|>
|1| Of course. House feeds on rift energy and Tardises are burstingwith it. And not raw, all lovely and cooked. Processed food. Mmm, fishfingers.<|endoftext|>
|0| Do fish have fingers?<|endoftext|>
|1| But you can't eat a Tardis. it would destroy you. Unless,unless<|endoftext|>
|0| Unless you deleted the Tardis Matrix first.<|endoftext|>
|1| So it deleted you.<|endoftext|>
|0| But House can't just delete a Tardis' consciousness. That wouldblow a hole in the universe. So he pulls out the Matrix, sticks it in aliving receptacle and then it feeds off the remaining Artron energy.Oh. You were about to say all that. I don't suppose you have to now.<|endoftext|>
|1| I sent Amy and Rory in there. They'll be eaten. Amy! Amy? Rory?Get the hell out of there.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's House. He's after the Tardis. Just getout both of you.<|endoftext|>
|0| We can't. You locked the door, remember?<|endoftext|>
|1| But I've unlocked it.<|endoftext|>
|0| You stupid well haven't.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, I don't like this.<|endoftext|>
|1| Open!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|1| Open this door!<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory, hold my hand.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy. Rory!<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy? Amy, can you hear me? (no) Okay, right. I don't, I reallydon't know what to do. That's a new feeling.<|endoftext|>
|0| Listen, whatever happens, at least we're together. And we're inthe Tardis, so we're safe.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're half right. I mean, you are in the Tardis. What agreat adventure. I should have done this half a million years ago. So,Amy, Rory, why shouldn't I just kill you now?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's gone.<|endoftext|>
|0| Eaten?<|endoftext|>
|1| No, it left. Not eaten, hi-jacked. But why?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's time for us both to go, and keep together.<|endoftext|>
|1| Whoa, whoa, whoa. Go? What do you mean, go? Where are yougoing?<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, we're dying, my love. It's time for Auntie and Uncle topop off.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm against it.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's your fault, isn't it, sweets? Because you told House itwas the last Tardis. House can't feed on them if there's none morecoming, can he?<|endoftext|>
|0| So now he's off to your universe to find more Tardises.<|endoftext|>
|1| It won't.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, it'll think of something.<|endoftext|>
|0| Actually, I feel fine.<|endoftext|>
|1| Not dead. You can't just die!<|endoftext|>
|0| We need to go to where I landed, Doctor, quickly.<|endoftext|>
|1| Why?<|endoftext|>
|0| Because we are there in three minutes. We need to go now. Ow.Roughly how long do these bodies last?<|endoftext|>
|1| You're dying.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, of course I'm dying. I don't belong in a flesh body. Icould blow the casing in no time. No, stop it. Don't get emotional.Hmm. That's what the orangey girl says. You're the Doctor. Focus.<|endoftext|>
|1| On what? How? I'm a madman with a box, without a box. I'm stuckdown the plughole at the end of the universe on a stupid old junkyard.Ooo.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ooo what?<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm not.<|endoftext|>
|0| Not what?<|endoftext|>
|1| Because it's not a junkyard. Don't you see? It's not ajunkyard.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is it then?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's a Tardis junkyard. Come on! Oh, sorry. Do you have a name?<|endoftext|>
|0| Seven hundred years, finally he asks.<|endoftext|>
|1| But what do I call you?<|endoftext|>
|0| I think you call me Sexy.<|endoftext|>
|1| Only when we're alone.<|endoftext|>
|0| We are alone.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh. Come on then, Sexy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Corridors. I have corridors. So much tolearn about my new home. But you haven't answered my question,children.<|endoftext|>
|0| Er, question?<|endoftext|>
|0| You remember. Tell me why I shouldn't just kill you bothnow?<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, because. Rory, why?<|endoftext|>
|0| Because killing us quickly wouldn't be any fun. And you need fun,don't you? That's what Uncle and Auntie were for, wasn't it? Someone tomake suffer. I had a PE teacher just like you. You need to beentertained, and killing us quickly wouldn't be entertainment.<|endoftext|>
|0| So entertain me. Run.<|endoftext|>
|1| A valley of half eaten Tardises. Are youthinking what I'm thinking?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm thinking that all of my sisters are dead. That they weredevoured, and that we are looking at their corpses.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah. Sorry. No, I wasn't thinking that.<|endoftext|>
|0| No. You were thinking you could build a working Tardis consoleout of broken remnants of a hundred different models. And you don'tcare that it's impossible.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's not impossible as long as we're alive. Rory and Amy needme. So yeah, we're going to build a Tardis.<|endoftext|>
|0| So are we having fun yet? I'm ratherenjoying the sensation of having you running around inside me.<|endoftext|>
|0| I've turned off the corridor anti-gravs, so do be careful.<|endoftext|>
|0| Come on.<|endoftext|>
|0| Bond the tube directly into the TachyonDiverter.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, yes, I have actually rebuilt a Tardis before, you know. Iknow what I'm doing.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're like a nine year old trying to rebuild a motorbike in hisbedroom. And you never read the instructions.<|endoftext|>
|1| I always read the instructions.<|endoftext|>
|0| There's a sign on my front door. You have been walking past itfor seven hundred years. What does it say?<|endoftext|>
|1| That's not instructions.<|endoftext|>
|0| There's an instruction at the bottom. What does it say?<|endoftext|>
|1| Pull to open.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes. And what do you do?<|endoftext|>
|1| I push.<|endoftext|>
|0| Every single time. Seven hundred years. Police Box doors openout the way.<|endoftext|>
|1| I think I have earned the right to open my front doors any wayI want.<|endoftext|>
|0| Your front doors? Have you any idea how childish that sounds?<|endoftext|>
|1| You are not my mother.<|endoftext|>
|0| And you are not my child.<|endoftext|>
|1| You know, since we're talking with mouths, not really anopportunity that comes along very often, I just want to say, you know,you have never been very reliable.<|endoftext|>
|0| And you have?<|endoftext|>
|1| You didn't always take me where I wanted to go.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, but I always took you where you needed to go.<|endoftext|>
|1| You did. Look at us talking. Wouldn't it be amazing if we couldalways talk, even when you're stuck inside the box?<|endoftext|>
|0| You know I'm not constructed that way. I exist across all spaceand time, and you talk and run around and bring home strays.<|endoftext|>
|1| You okay?<|endoftext|>
|0| One of the kidneys has already failed. It doesn't matter. Weneed to finish assembling the console.<|endoftext|>
|1| Using a console without a proper shell. It's not going to besafe.<|endoftext|>
|0| This body has about eighteen minutes left to live. The universewe're in will reach Absolute Zero in three hours. Safe is relative.<|endoftext|>
|1| Then we need to get a move on. Eh, old girl?<|endoftext|>
|0| No! Amy!<|endoftext|>
|0| No!<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy? Amy? Amy?<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory?<|endoftext|>
|0| Where have you been?<|endoftext|>
|0| I stepped through that door and it came down here.<|endoftext|>
|0| But you've been hours.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, I haven't. It's House, and it's messing with the Tardis. Comeon, back this way.<|endoftext|>
|0| No!<|endoftext|>
|0| No! Oh.<|endoftext|>
|0| You'll need to install the time rotor.<|endoftext|>
|1| How is this going to make it through the rift? How? We'realmost done. Thrust diffuser? Er, retroscope. Blue thingy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Do you ever wonder why I chose you all those years ago?<|endoftext|>
|1| I chose you. You were unlocked.<|endoftext|>
|0| Of course I was. I wanted to see the universe, so I stole a TimeLord and I ran away. And you were the only one mad enough.<|endoftext|>
|1| Right. Perfect. Look at that. What could possibly go wrong?<|endoftext|>
|1| That's fine. That always happens. No, hang on. Wait.<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, my God. Rory?<|endoftext|>
|0| You left me. How could you do that? How could you leave me?<|endoftext|>
|0| How long have you been here?<|endoftext|>
|0| Two thousand years I waited for you. You did it to me again.<|endoftext|>
|0| I didn't mean to. I didn't mean to. I'm sorry. Rory, what are youdoing?<|endoftext|>
|0| They come for me at night. Every single night, they come for meand they hurt me. Amy, they hurt me over and over and over and over<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory.<|endoftext|>
|0| How could you leave me? How could you do that to me?<|endoftext|>
|1| Right. Okay, let's go. Follow that Tardis.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh no, come on. There's rift energy everywhere. You can do it.Okay, diverting all power to thrust. Let's be having you.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, no, no, no.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's wrong?<|endoftext|>
|1| It can't hold the charge. It can't even start. There's nopower. I've got nothing.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, my beautiful idiot. You have what you've always had. You'vegot me.<|endoftext|>
|0| No! No! Rory, I'm so, so sorry.<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's messing with our heads. Come on, run.<|endoftext|>
|1| Whoo hoo!<|endoftext|>
|0| We've locked on to them. They'll have to lower the shields whenI'm close enough to phase inside.<|endoftext|>
|1| Can you get a message to Amy? The telepathic circuits areonline.<|endoftext|>
|0| Which one's Amy? The pretty one?<|endoftext|>
|0| Argh.<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory, what's wrong?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's like I'm getting a message.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello, Pretty.<|endoftext|>
|0| What the hell is that?<|endoftext|>
|1| Don't worry. Telepathic messaging. No, that's Rory.<|endoftext|>
|0| You have to go to the old control room. I'm putting the route inyour head. When you get there use the purple slider on the nearestpanel to lower the shields.<|endoftext|>
|1| The pretty one?<|endoftext|>
|0| You'll have about twelve seconds before the room goes into phasewith the invading Matrix. I'll send you the pass key when you getthere. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
|0| What was that?<|endoftext|>
|0| It was that woman. That mad woman and the Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|0| We have to keep going.<|endoftext|>
|1| How's he going to be able to take down theshields anyway? The House is in the control room.<|endoftext|>
|0| I directed him to one of the old control rooms.<|endoftext|>
|1| There aren't any old control rooms. They were all deleted orremodelled.<|endoftext|>
|0| I archive them, for neatness. I've got about thirty now.<|endoftext|>
|1| But I've only changed the desktop, what, a dozen times?<|endoftext|>
|0| So far, yes.<|endoftext|>
|1| You can't archive something that hasn't happened yet.<|endoftext|>
|0| You can't.<|endoftext|>
|0| What happened to the lights?<|endoftext|>
|0| The lights are fine. Oh, it's messing with our heads again. Okay,stay there a second.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is it? What?<|endoftext|>
|0| Just hang on.<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't leave me. I can hardly see, you idiot.<|endoftext|>
|0| Argh.<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory? Rory?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's okay, I'm fine. Come towards my voice.<|endoftext|>
|0| What happened? Where are you?<|endoftext|>
|0| I just banged my head. Just keep coming. Reach out yourhand.<|endoftext|>
|0| This way. Come on, run!<|endoftext|>
|1| Keep going. You're doing it, you sexything.<|endoftext|>
|0| See, you do call me that. Is it my name?<|endoftext|>
|1| You bet it's your name.<|endoftext|>
|0| Whoo!<|endoftext|>
|0| I can see now, Rory. I can see.<|endoftext|>
|0| It was the Ood thing, the Nephew and it's still coming.<|endoftext|>
|0| I know. So where is this place?<|endoftext|>
|0| This is where she told me to go. She said she'd send me the passkey. Ow!<|endoftext|>
|0| Crimson. Eleven. Delight. Petrichor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Petrichor?<|endoftext|>
|0| What do I do? Do I say it? Crimson. Eleven. Delight. Petrichor. Isaid it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Petrichor. Petrichor.<|endoftext|>
|0| I said it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Petrichor. She told you what it meant. The smell of wet dust,remember? So, oh, it's the meaning, not the word.<|endoftext|>
|0| The meaning of what?<|endoftext|>
|0| The Tardis interface is telepathic. You don't say it, you thinkit.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's coming.<|endoftext|>
|0| Quiet. Crimson. Eleven. Delight. The smell of dust after rain.Crimson, eleven, delight, the smell of dust after rain. Crimson,eleven, delight, the smell of dust after rain.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is this place? Another control room?<|endoftext|>
|0| Right, shields. Got it.<|endoftext|>
|0| They did it. Shields down.<|endoftext|>
|0| How did you find this place? It's noton my internal schematics. I had hoped you two could join Nephew as myservants. But you two are nothing but trouble. Nephew, kill them.<|endoftext|>
|0| We're coming through. Get out of the way or you'll be atomised.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where are you coming through?<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't know.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, great. Thanks.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's not going to hold.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hold on.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Not good. Not good at all. How do you walk around in thesethings?<|endoftext|>
|1| We're not quite there yet. Just hold on. Amy, this is, well,she's my Tardis. Except she's a woman. She's a woman, and she's myTardis.<|endoftext|>
|0| She's the Tardis?<|endoftext|>
|1| And she's a woman. She's a woman and she's the Tardis.<|endoftext|>
|0| Did you wish really hard?<|endoftext|>
|1| Shut up. Not like that.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello. I'm Sexy.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh. Still shut up.<|endoftext|>
|0| The environment has been breached. Nephew, kill them all.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where's Nephew?<|endoftext|>
|0| He was standing right where you materialised.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah. Well, he must have been redistributed.<|endoftext|>
|0| Meaning what?<|endoftext|>
|1| You're breathing him.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, come on.<|endoftext|>
|1| Another Ood I failed to save.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor. I did not expect you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, that's me all over, isn't it? Lovely old unexpected me.<|endoftext|>
|0| The big question is, now you're here, how to dispose ofyou? I could play with gravity.<|endoftext|>
|0| Or I could evacuate the air from this room and watch youchoke.<|endoftext|>
|1| You really don't want to do that.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why shouldn't I just kill you now?<|endoftext|>
|1| Because then I won't be able to help you. Listen to yourengines. Just listen to them. You don't have the thrust and you knowit. Right now I'm your only hope for getting out of your little bubblethrough the rift, and into my universe. And mine's the one with thefood in.<|endoftext|>
|0| Water, water.<|endoftext|>
|1| You just have to promise not to kill us. That's all, justpromise.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm very serious. I'm sure it's an entity of its word.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, she's burning up. She's asking for water.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hey. Hang in there, old girl. Not long now. It'll be over soon.<|endoftext|>
|0| I always liked it when you call me old girl.<|endoftext|>
|0| You want me to give my word? Easy. I promise.<|endoftext|>
|1| Fine. Okay. I trust you. Just delete, oh er, thirty percent ofthe Tardis rooms, you'll free up thrust enough to make it through.Activate subroutine Sigma nine.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why would you tell me this?<|endoftext|>
|1| Because we want to get back to our universe as badly as you do.And I'm nice.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes. I can delete rooms. And I can also rid myself ofvermin if I delete this room first. Thank you, Doctor. Very helpful.Goodbye, Time Lord. Goodbye, little humans. Goodbye, Idris.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes. I mean, you could do that, but it just won't work.Hardwired fail safe. Living things from rooms that are deleted areautomatically deposited in the main control room. But thanks for thelift.<|endoftext|>
|0| We are in your universe now, Doctor. Why should it matterto me in which room you die? I can kill you just as easily here asanywhere. Fear me. I've killed hundreds of Time Lords.<|endoftext|>
|1| Fear me. I've killed all of them.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't understand. There isn't a forest in here.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, you're right. You've completely won. Oh, you can kill usin oodles of really inventive ways, but before you do kill us allow meand friends Amy and Rory to congratulate you on being an absolutelyworthy opponent.<|endoftext|>
|0| Congratulations.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yep, you've defeated us. Me and my lovely friends here, andlast but definitely not least, the Tardis Matrix herself, a livingconsciousness you ripped out of this very control room and locked upinto a human body. And look at her.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, she's stopped breathing.<|endoftext|>
|0| Enough. That is enough.<|endoftext|>
|1| No. It's never enough. You forced the Tardis into a body soshe'd burn out safely a very long way away from this control room. Aflesh body can't hold the Tardis Matrix and live. Look at her body,House.<|endoftext|>
|0| And you think I should mourn her?<|endoftext|>
|1| No. I think you should be very, very careful about what you letback into this control room. You took her from her home. But now she'sback in the box again, and she's free.<|endoftext|>
|0| No. Doctor, stop this. Argh! Stop this now.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, look at my girl. Look at her go. Bigger on the inside. Yousee, House?<|endoftext|>
|0| Make her stop.<|endoftext|>
|1| That's your problem. Size of a planet, but inside you are justso small.<|endoftext|>
|0| Make it stop.<|endoftext|>
|1| Finish him off, girl.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ow. Don't do this! Argh!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, are you there? It's so very dark in here.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm here.<|endoftext|>
|0| I've been looking for a word. A big, complicated word, but sosad. I've found it now.<|endoftext|>
|1| What word?<|endoftext|>
|0| Alive. I'm alive.<|endoftext|>
|1| Alive isn't sad.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's sad when it's over. I'll always be here, but this is whenwe talked, and now even that has come to an end. There's something Ididn't get to say to you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Goodbye?<|endoftext|>
|0| No. I just wanted to say hello. Hello, Doctor. It's so very,very nice to meet you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Please. I don't want you to. Please.<|endoftext|>
|1| Where?<|endoftext|>
|0| How's it going under there?<|endoftext|>
|1| Just putting a firewall around the Matrix. Almost done.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you going to make her talk again?<|endoftext|>
|1| I can't.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why not?<|endoftext|>
|0| Spacey wacey, isn't it?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, actually, it's because the Time Lords discovered that ifyou take an eleventh dimensional matrix and fold it into a mechanicalthen. Yes, it's spacey wacey.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry. At the end, she was talking. She kept repeating something.I don't know what it meant.<|endoftext|>
|1| What did she say?<|endoftext|>
|0| The only water in the forest is the river. She said we'd need toknow that someday. It doesn't make sense, does it?<|endoftext|>
|1| Not yet. You okay?<|endoftext|>
|0| No. I watched her die. I shouldn't let it get to me, but it stilldoes. I'm a nurse.<|endoftext|>
|1| Letting it get to you. You know what that's called? Beingalive. Best thing there is. Being alive right now, that's all thatcounts. Nearly finished. Two more minutes, then we're off. The Eye ofOrion's restful, if you like restful. I can never really get the hangof restful. What do you think, dear? Where shall we take the kids thistime?<|endoftext|>
|0| Look at you pair. It's always you and her, isn't it, long afterthe rest of us have gone. A boy and his box, off to see the universe.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, you say that as if it's a bad thing. But honestly, it'sthe best thing there is. The House deleted all the bedrooms. I shouldprobably make you two a new bedroom. You'd like that, wouldn't you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay. Er, Doctor, this time could we lose the bunk beds?<|endoftext|>
|1| No. Bunk beds are cool. A bed with a ladder. You can't beatthat. It's your room. Out those stairs, keep walking till you find it.Off you pop.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, do you have a room?<|endoftext|>
|1| Are you there? Can you hear me? Oh, I'm a silly old. Okay. TheEye of Orion, or wherever we need to go.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ha ha! Whoo hoo.<|endoftext|>
|0| Lights.<|endoftext|>
|0| Lights. You know the drill, people. Plasticvisors down and locked. Buzzer?<|endoftext|>
|0| Reading of nine point seven.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sounds a bit low for unrefined. How's the average?<|endoftext|>
|0| The acid potency stats have definitely dropped below the meanduring the last quarter.<|endoftext|>
|0| Prettier than a computer, isn't she?<|endoftext|>
|0| Give over, Buzz.<|endoftext|>
|0| Buzzer. Buzz.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, great. Nice going, twinkle toes.<|endoftext|>
|0| I shouldn't have swung at him. Sorry, Buzz. My bad.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, you're all right. Jimmy?<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, no point carrying you back legless. Sorry, Buzzer. You'redead.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, this is a right pain in the armour. Heart's gone now.<|endoftext|>
|0| Look, we'd best get off. Got to write this one up for the boss.Those suits cost a bomb. If I miss my boy's birthday filling out forms,I'll kill you again.<|endoftext|>
|0| Lights.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm looking at these readings, Jimmy, andthe potency stats are way too low. We may have to take that read again.This thing is still jamming up on me.<|endoftext|>
|0| So I think we'd better talk about what just happened backthere. I could get compensation. I've seen the holo-ads. Had anaccident in the workplace? Yeah, I have as it goes. I melted.<|endoftext|>
|0| Let it go.<|endoftext|>
|0| Just remember. When you're doing your report, it wasn't myfault. She took a swing at me.<|endoftext|>
|0| I never touched you. You've got two left feet, Buzzer.<|endoftext|>
|0| I haven't got two left feet. Or any arms, neck, head, the chin.This body costs money, love.<|endoftext|>
|0| Not as much as that acid suit.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, lighten up. It's not like anyone was hurt.<|endoftext|>
|0| Forty six. Rubbishy, rubbishy, rubbish.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello? It's a double top.<|endoftext|>
|0| Wrong side of the wire, mister.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're on the oche, Red.<|endoftext|>
|1| Who wants fish and chips?<|endoftext|>
|1| I'll drop you both off. Take your time. Don't rush.<|endoftext|>
|0| Er, and you? Things to do. Things involving other things.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, we'll stay with you. We'll do the other things.<|endoftext|>
|1| Nope.<|endoftext|>
|0| Whatever you're up to, I'd personally like to be a part of it.What?<|endoftext|>
|1| Solar tsunami. Came directly from your sun. A tidal wave ofradiation. Big, big, big.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh Doctor, my tummy's going funny.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, the gyrator disconnected. Target tracking is out.<|endoftext|>
|1| Assume the position!<|endoftext|>
|1| Textbook landing.<|endoftext|>
|1| Behold, a cockerel! Love a cockerel.<|endoftext|>
|1| And underneath, a monastery. Thirteenth century.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, we've gone all mediaeval.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm not sure about that.<|endoftext|>
|0| Really? Mediaeval expert are you?<|endoftext|>
|0| No, it's just that I can hear Dusty Springfield.<|endoftext|>
|1| These fissures are new. Solar tsunami sent out a huge wave ofgamma particles. This is caused by a magnetic quake that occurs justbefore the wave hits.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, the monastery's standing.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, for now.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, look.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah. It's a supply pipe. Ceramic inner lining. Somethingcorrosive. They're pumping something nasty off this island to themainland.<|endoftext|>
|0| My mum's a massive fan of Dusty Springfield.<|endoftext|>
|1| Who isn't? Right, let's go. Satisfy our rabid curiosity.<|endoftext|>
|0| So where are these Dusty Springfield lovingmonks, then?<|endoftext|>
|1| I think we're here. This is it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, what are you talking about? We've never been here before.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hmm?<|endoftext|>
|0| We came here by accident?<|endoftext|>
|1| Accident? Yes, I know. Accident.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ow!<|endoftext|>
|1| Acid. They're pumping acid off this island. That's old stuff.Fresh acid, you wouldn't have a finger.<|endoftext|>
|0| Intruder alert. Intruder alert.<|endoftext|>
|1| There are people coming. Well, almost.<|endoftext|>
|0| Almost coming?<|endoftext|>
|1| Almost people.<|endoftext|>
|0| I think we should really be going.<|endoftext|>
|0| Come on!<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm telling you. When something runs towards you, it is never fora nice reason.<|endoftext|>
|0| What are all these harnesses for?<|endoftext|>
|0| The almost people?<|endoftext|>
|0| What are they, prisoners, or are they meditating, or what?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, at the moment they fall into the or what category.<|endoftext|>
|0| Halt and remain calm.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, we've halted. How are we all doing on the calm front?<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't move!<|endoftext|>
|0| Stay back, Jen. We don't know who they are.<|endoftext|>
|0| So let's ask them. Who the hell are you?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, I'm the Doctor, and this is Amy and Rory, and it's allvery nice, isn't it?<|endoftext|>
|0| Hold up. You're all. What are you all? Like identical twins?<|endoftext|>
|0| This is an Alpha Grade industrial facility. Unless you workfor the military or for Morpeth Jetson, you are in big trouble.<|endoftext|>
|1| Actually, you're in big trouble.<|endoftext|>
|0| Meteorological Department? Since when?<|endoftext|>
|1| Since you were hit by a solar wave.<|endoftext|>
|0| Which we survived.<|endoftext|>
|1| Just, by the look of it. And there's a bigger one on the way.<|endoftext|>
|0| Which we'll also survive. Dicken, scan for bugs.<|endoftext|>
|0| Backs against the wall. Now.<|endoftext|>
|1| You're not a monastery, you're a factory. Twenty second centuryarmy-owned factory.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're army?<|endoftext|>
|0| No, love. We're contractors, and you're trespassers.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's clear, boss.<|endoftext|>
|0| All right, weatherman, your ID checks out. If there's anothersolar storm, what are you going to do about it? Hand out sunblock?<|endoftext|>
|1| I need to see your critical systems.<|endoftext|>
|0| Which one?<|endoftext|>
|1| You know which one.<|endoftext|>
|1| And there you are.<|endoftext|>
|0| Meet the government's worst kept secret. The Flesh. It's fullyprogrammable matter. In fact, it's even learning to replicate itself atthe cellular level.<|endoftext|>
|0| Right. Brilliant. Lost.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay. Once a reading's been taken, we can manipulate itsmolecular structure into anything. Replicate a living organism down tothe hairs on its chinny chin chin. Even clothes. And everything'sidentical. Eyes, voice<|endoftext|>
|1| Mind, soul?<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't be fooled, Doctor. It acts like life but it still needsto be controlled by us, from those harnesses you saw.<|endoftext|>
|0| Wait, whoa. Hold it. So, you're Flesh now?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm lying in a harness back in that chamber. We all are,except Jennifer here. Don't be scared. This thing, just like operatinga forklift truck.<|endoftext|>
|1| You said it could grow. Only living things grow.<|endoftext|>
|0| Moss grows. It's no more than that. This acid is so dangerouswe were losing a worker every week. So now we mine the acid using thesedoppelgangers. Or Gangers. If these bodies get burnt or fall in theacid<|endoftext|>
|0| Then who the hell cares, right, Jen?<|endoftext|>
|0| Nerve endings automatically cut off like airbags beingdischarged. We wake up and get a new Ganger.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's weird, but you get used to it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Jennifer, I want you in your Ganger. Get back to the harness.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hang on, what's he up to? What you up to, pal?<|endoftext|>
|1| Stop it. Strange. It was like for a moment there it wasscanning me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Get back, Doctor. Leave it alone.<|endoftext|>
|1| I understand.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor? Are you all right?<|endoftext|>
|1| Incredible. You have no idea. No idea. I mean, I felt it in mymind. I reached out to it, and it to me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't fiddle with the money, Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| How can you be so blinkered? It's alive. So alive. You'repiling your lives, your personalities directly into it.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's the solar storm. The first waves come in pairs. Pre-shockand fore-shock. It's close.<|endoftext|>
|0| Buzzer, we got anything from the mainland yet?<|endoftext|>
|0| No, the comms are still too jammed with radiation.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay. Then we'll keep pumping acid until the mainland saysstop. Now why don't you stand back and let us impress you?<|endoftext|>
|0| ID confirmed. Jennifer Lucas.<|endoftext|>
|0| The meter is running.<|endoftext|>
|0| Cardio and respiratory online. Motor functions online.Plumbing in.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, I can see why you keep it in a church. Miracle of life.<|endoftext|>
|0| No need to get poncey. It's just gunge.<|endoftext|>
|0| Guys, we need to get to work.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, everybody, let's crack on.<|endoftext|>
|1| Did I mention the solar storm? You need to get out of here.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where do you want us to go? We're on a tiny island.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, I can get you all off it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't be ridiculous. We've got a job to do.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's coming.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's the alarm.<|endoftext|>
|1| How do you get power?<|endoftext|>
|0| We're solar. We use a solar router. The weathervane.<|endoftext|>
|1| Big problem.<|endoftext|>
|0| Boss, maybe if the storm's back we should get underground. Thefactory's seen better days. The acid pipes might not withstand anotherhit.<|endoftext|>
|0| We have two hundred tons of acid to pump out. We fall behind,we stay another rotation. Anyone want that?<|endoftext|>
|1| Please, you are making a massive mistake here. You're right atthe crossroads of it. Don't turn the wrong way. If you don't, if youdon't prepare for this storm, you are all in terrible danger.Understand?<|endoftext|>
|0| My factory, my rules.<|endoftext|>
|1| I need to check the progress of the storm. Monitoring station?Monitoring station.<|endoftext|>
|0| Three lefts, a right and a left. Third door on your left.<|endoftext|>
|1| Thank you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Waves disturbing the Earth's magnetic field. There is going tobe the mother and father of all power surges. See this weathervane, thecock-a-doodle-do? It's a solar router feeding the whole factory withsolar power. When that wave hits,ka-boom. I've to get to that cockerel before all hell breaks loose. Inever thought I'd have to say that again. Amy, breathe.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah! I mean, thanks. I'll try.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh. For want of a better word, ow!<|endoftext|>
|1| Cleaves, you're not in your harness.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm sorry, Doctor. You were right.<|endoftext|>
|1| You've lost all power to the factory.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, I abandoned my team.<|endoftext|>
|1| Then let's go get them.<|endoftext|>
|1| How long would you say we were unconsciousfor, Cleaves?<|endoftext|>
|0| Not long. A minute, two minutes?<|endoftext|>
|1| I'd hazard we've been out a teensy bit longer.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, how long?<|endoftext|>
|1| An hour. I've seen whole worlds turned inside out in an hour. Alot can go wrong in an hour.<|endoftext|>
|0| I feel like I been toasted.<|endoftext|>
|0| What the hell happened?<|endoftext|>
|0| The tsunami happened. You hurt?<|endoftext|>
|0| It feels like the National Grid's run through my bones but apartfrom that<|endoftext|>
|0| I hope the meter's not bust. I still want to get paid.<|endoftext|>
|0| Jennifer! Jennifer. Hey, all right?<|endoftext|>
|0| It hurt so much.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hey. Hey, it's okay. It's over.<|endoftext|>
|0| I couldn't get out of my harness.<|endoftext|>
|0| Shush.<|endoftext|>
|0| I thought I was going to die.<|endoftext|>
|0| Welcome to my world.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, these are all real people, so where are their Gangers?<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't worry. When the link shuts down the Gangers return topure Flesh. Now, the storm's left us with acid leaks all over, so weneed to contact the mainland. They can have a rescue shuttle out herein no time.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's my record. Who's playing my record?<|endoftext|>
|1| Your Gangers. They've gone walkabout.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, it's impossible. They're not active. Cars don't flythemselves, cranes don't lift themselves and Gangers don't<|endoftext|>
|0| No way.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't, I don't believe this.<|endoftext|>
|0| They could've escaped through the service door at the back.<|endoftext|>
|0| This is just like the Isle of Sheppey.<|endoftext|>
|1| It would seem the storm has animated your Gangers.<|endoftext|>
|0| They've ransacked everything.<|endoftext|>
|1| Not ransacked, searched.<|endoftext|>
|0| Through our stuff!<|endoftext|>
|1| Their stuff.<|endoftext|>
|0| Searching for what?<|endoftext|>
|1| Confirmation. They need to know their memories are real.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, so they've got flaming memories now.<|endoftext|>
|1| They feel compelled to connect to their lives.<|endoftext|>
|0| Their stolen lives.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, bequeathed. You gave them this. You poured in yourpersonalities, emotions, traits, memories, secrets, everything. Yougave them your lives. Human lives are amazing. Are you surprised theywalked off with them?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'll say it again. Isle of Sheppey. Ganger got an electricshock, toddled off, killed his operator right there in his harness.I've seen the photos. This bloke's ear was all hanging<|endoftext|>
|0| Even if this has actually happened, they can't remain stablewithout us plumbed in to them, can they, boss.<|endoftext|>
|0| Guess we'll find out.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you okay? Do you need some water?<|endoftext|>
|0| I feel funny. I need the washroom.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'll come with you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh! Okay.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's me. It's good to have a hobby. So what, my Ganger didthat all on its own?<|endoftext|>
|1| Who taught you to do this?<|endoftext|>
|0| My granddad.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, your Ganger's granddad taught him to do it, too. You bothhave the same childhood memories, just as clear, just as real.<|endoftext|>
|0| No.<|endoftext|>
|1| Scared, disorientated, struggling to come to terms with anentire life in their heads.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Doctor's always saying don't wander off.First rule with him, actually. Don't wander off.<|endoftext|>
|0| I just need a minute.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, yeah. Sure. Take all the time you need. I've got your back.You're fine.<|endoftext|>
|0| Er, Jennifer? What's up, Jennifer?<|endoftext|>
|0| Just let us live.<|endoftext|>
|0| We need to protect ourselves.<|endoftext|>
|1| Are you a violent man, Jimmy?<|endoftext|>
|0| No.<|endoftext|>
|1| Then why would the other Jimmy be?<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't tell me you can eat at a time like this, Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| You told me we were out cold for a few minutes, Cleaves, whenin fact it was an hour.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry, I just assumed<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, it's not your fault. Like I said, they're disoriented.Amy, when you got to the alcoves, who was in harness?<|endoftext|>
|0| Jimmy and Dicken were helping Buzzer out.<|endoftext|>
|1| Jennifer?<|endoftext|>
|0| She was standing on her own when we got to her.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's hot.<|endoftext|>
|1| Trans-matter's still a little rubbery. Nerve endings not quitefused properly.<|endoftext|>
|0| What are you talking about?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's okay.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why didn't I feel that?<|endoftext|>
|1| You will. You'll stabilise.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, stop it. You're playing stupid games. Stop it!<|endoftext|>
|1| You don't have to hide. Please, trust me. I'm the Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where's the real Cleaves, you thing? What have you done withher?<|endoftext|>
|1| That's it. Good, you remember. This is early Flesh. The earlystages of the technology. So much to learn.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, what's happened to her?<|endoftext|>
|1| She can't stabilise. She's shifting between half-formed andfull-formed, for now at least.<|endoftext|>
|0| We are living.<|endoftext|>
|1| Let her go.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, Rory.<|endoftext|>
|1| Rory?<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory!<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, Rory. Rory! Always with the Rory.<|endoftext|>
|0| Explosion must've ruptured the acid feeds. We're going to needthe acid suits.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, no, no. We haven't got time. Back, back, back!<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory? Rory? Rory?<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory.<|endoftext|>
|1| Of course, Jennifer's a Ganger too.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, you said they wouldn't be violent.<|endoftext|>
|1| But I did say they were scared and angry.<|endoftext|>
|0| And early technology, is what you said. You seem to knowsomething about the Flesh.<|endoftext|>
|0| Do you? Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|0| You're no weatherman. Why are you really here?<|endoftext|>
|1| I have to talk to them. I can fix this.<|endoftext|>
|0| Wait. What's going on? Where's the real Jennifer?<|endoftext|>
|1| It is too dangerous out here with acid leaks.<|endoftext|>
|0| We have to find Rory.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes. I'm going back to the Tardis. Wait for me in the dininghall. I want us to keep together, okay. No more wandering off.<|endoftext|>
|0| And what about Rory?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, it would be safer to look for Rory and Jennifer with theTardis.<|endoftext|>
|0| Here we go. Distress flares.<|endoftext|>
|1| Exit?<|endoftext|>
|0| Keep going straight. Can't miss it. But you're never going toget your vehicle in here.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm a great parker.<|endoftext|>
|0| We really need those acid suits. I've sent Buzzer and Dicken toget them.<|endoftext|>
|0| Fine and dandy. I'm just going to find my husband, so cheers.<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy, I wouldn't.<|endoftext|>
|0| Nor would I. What can you do, eh?<|endoftext|>
|0| At least wait for an acid suit.<|endoftext|>
|0| When I was a little girl, I got lost on the moors, wanderedoff from the picnic. I can still feel how sore my toes got inside myred welly boots. And I imagined another little girl, just like me, inred wellies, and she was Jennifer too. Except she was a strongJennifer, a tough Jennifer. She'd lead me home. My name is JenniferLucas. I am not a factory part. I had toast for my breakfast. I wrote aletter to my mum. And then you arrived. I noticed your eyes right off.<|endoftext|>
|0| Did you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Nice eyes. Kind.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where is the real Jennifer?<|endoftext|>
|0| I am Jennifer Lucas. I remember everything that happened inher entire life. Every birthday, every childhood illness. I feeleverything she has ever felt and more. I'm not a monster! I am me. Me!Me! Me!<|endoftext|>
|0| Why did they do this to us? Help me, Rory. Help me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Shush, shush.<|endoftext|>
|0| Trust me.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh. What are you doing down there?<|endoftext|>
|0| Clear.<|endoftext|>
|0| Those damn Gangers got to the acid suits.<|endoftext|>
|0| There is acid leaking everywhere. Did you see the boss' eyesback there in the hall?<|endoftext|>
|0| I've never seen a Ganger look at me like that.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't know what they are now, but they ain't us.<|endoftext|>
|0| We have the advantage now. We have the acid suits. We canmove freely. Strike at will.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you sure you're feeling better? No moresuper-elastic punches?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm different now. Stronger.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Doctor won't hurt you. He wants to help, Jennifer, okay?<|endoftext|>
|0| You used my name. You used my name. Thank you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy's a lucky girl.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, she is. Let's go.<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory. Rory?<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy!<|endoftext|>
|0| You're okay. What happened?<|endoftext|>
|0| She needs protecting.<|endoftext|>
|0| Jen?<|endoftext|>
|0| No, it's a Ganger. Rory, listen.<|endoftext|>
|0| Look, you listen. Nobody touches her.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hello. How are you all getting on?<|endoftext|>
|0| Why don't you tell us?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, we have two choices. The first is to tear each otherapart. Not my favourite. The second is to knuckle down and worktogether. Try to work out how best we can help you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Now, I know its hard for you to hold your fully human form.That's why you keep shifting between the Flesh stages, but do try.It'll make the others less scared of you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where's Jen? What have you done with her?<|endoftext|>
|0| I haven't seen her, I swear. But look, I'm her. I'm justlike her. I'm real.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're a copy. You're just pretending to be like her.<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory, we don't really know anything about them yet.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, I know that she's afraid and she needs our help.<|endoftext|>
|0| Jimmy, Buzzer. Come on, you guys. We've worked together fortwo years.<|endoftext|>
|0| I worked with Jennifer Lucas, not you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, let's not do anything at all<|endoftext|>
|0| Until the Doctor gets here. Hello.<|endoftext|>
|0| This is<|endoftext|>
|0| You're telling me.<|endoftext|>
|0| All right, Doctor, you've brought us together. Now what?<|endoftext|>
|1| Before we do anything, I have one very important question. Hasanybody got a pair of shoes I could borrow? Size ten. Although I shouldwarn you, I have very wide feet.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's it, Doctor befriend them. Team upwith them, why don't you? Make a football team. How about that? You'regoing to have us all together singing campfire songs.<|endoftext|>
|1| The Flesh was never merely moss. These are not copies. Thestorm has hardwired them. They are becoming people.<|endoftext|>
|0| With souls?<|endoftext|>
|0| Rubbish! Achoo.<|endoftext|>
|1| Bless you. We were all jelly once. Little jelly eggs sitting ingoop.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, thanks. Too much information.<|endoftext|>
|1| We are not talking about an accident that needs to be moppedup. We are talking about sacred life. Do you understand? Good. Now, theTardis is trapped in an acid pool. Once I can reach her, I can get youall off this island, humans and Gangers, eh? How does that sound?<|endoftext|>
|0| Can I make it home for Adam's birthday?<|endoftext|>
|0| What about me? He's my son too.<|endoftext|>
|0| You? You really think that?<|endoftext|>
|0| I feel it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, so you were there when he was born, were you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah. I drank about eight pints of tea, then they told me Ihad a wee boy and I just burst out laughing. No idea why. I miss home,as much as you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Look, I'm not going to lie to you. It's a right old mess, this.But as you might say up North, oh well, I'll just go to't foot ofstairs. Eee by by gum. Or not. Good. Right. First step is we geteveryone together, then get everyone safe. Then, get everyone out ofhere.<|endoftext|>
|0| But we're still missing Jennifer and Cleaves.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'll go and look for them.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'll give you a hand, if you like. Cover more ground.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, okay. Thanks.<|endoftext|>
|0| This circus has gone on long enough.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, great. You see, that is just so typically me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, tell it to shut up!<|endoftext|>
|1| Cleaves, no. No, no.<|endoftext|>
|0| Circuit probe. Fires about ooo, forty thousand volts? Wouldkill any one of us, so I guess she'll work on Gangers just the same.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's interesting you refer to them as it, but you call aglorified cattle prod a she.<|endoftext|>
|0| When the real people are safely off this island, then I'llhappily talk philosophy over a pint with you, Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| What are you going to do to them?<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry. They're monsters. Mistakes. They have to be destroyed.<|endoftext|>
|1| Give me the probe, Cleaves.<|endoftext|>
|0| We always have to take charge, don't we, Miranda. Even when wedon't really know what the hell is going on.<|endoftext|>
|1| Argh! He's dead!<|endoftext|>
|0| We call it decommissioned.<|endoftext|>
|1| You stopped his heart. He had a heart. Aorta, valves, a realhuman heart. And you stopped it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Jen?<|endoftext|>
|0| What happened to Buzzer will happen to all of us if wetrust you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Wait, wait, just wait.<|endoftext|>
|0| No!<|endoftext|>
|0| You idiot!<|endoftext|>
|1| Wait! Look at what you have done, Cleaves.<|endoftext|>
|0| If it's war, then it's war. You don't get it, Doctor. How canyou? It's us and them now. Us and them.<|endoftext|>
|0| Us and them.<|endoftext|>
|0| (sighs) Us and them.<|endoftext|>
|0| You tried. We all tried and look whatthey did. Us and them now.<|endoftext|>
|0| Us and them.<|endoftext|>
|0| Us and them.<|endoftext|>
|0| Jennifer.<|endoftext|>
|0| Buzzer warned you it was a trick and now he's dead. If wewant to live, then it's time to go to war. I'll take care of the spareone running around out there.<|endoftext|>
|0| Trust me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Look, I just wanted to help her.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, we all do, okay?<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't be like that. Listen, she's<|endoftext|>
|0| I said I agree with you. Drop it.<|endoftext|>
|1| The most fortified and defendable room in the monastery.Cleaves, the most fortified and defendable room in the monastery.<|endoftext|>
|0| The chapel.<|endoftext|>
|1| Thank you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Only one way in. Stone walls two feet thick.<|endoftext|>
|1| You've crossed one hell of a line, Cleaves. You've killed oneof them. They're coming back, in a big way.<|endoftext|>
|0| Jennifer!<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory?<|endoftext|>
|0| What about the flares?<|endoftext|>
|1| We'll worry about the flares when we're locked inside. Rory,Pond.<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory, come on.<|endoftext|>
|0| Jen's out there. She's out there and she's on her own.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, if she's got any sense, then she's hiding. Rory!<|endoftext|>
|0| I can't leave her out there!<|endoftext|>
|1| Rory.<|endoftext|>
|0| I know you understand that.<|endoftext|>
|0| Get in here. Get in here!<|endoftext|>
|0| There they are.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory!<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy, they are not after him, they're afterus.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why? Why?<|endoftext|>
|1| Show yourself. Show yourself!<|endoftext|>
|0| Jennifer?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|0| Pass me the barrel.<|endoftext|>
|0| We need something heavy. Anything you can find.<|endoftext|>
|0| This is insane. We're fighting ourselves.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes. Yes, it's insane, and it's about to get even moreinsanerer. Is that a word? Show yourself, right now!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, we are trapped in here and Rory's out there with them.Hello? We can't get to the Tardis and we can't even leave the island.<|endoftext|>
|0| Correct in every respect, Pond. It's frightening, unexpected,frankly a total, utter splattering mess on the carpet, but I amcertain, one hundred percent certain, that we can work this out. Trustme. I'm the Doctor. <|endoftext|>
|0| Argh. What's happening? I wonder if we'll get back. Yes, oneday. Argh. I've reversed the polarity of the neutron flow.<|endoftext|>
|1| The Flesh is struggling to cope with our past regenerations.Hold on.<|endoftext|>
|0| Would you like a jelly baby?<|endoftext|>
|0| Why? Why? Why?<|endoftext|>
|1| Why what?<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello. I'm the Doctor. No, let it go, we've moved on.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hold on, hold on, you can stabilise.<|endoftext|>
|0| I've reversed the jelly baby of the neutron flow. Would youlike a Doctor, Doctor, I'm, I'm the. I can't.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, listen, hold on. Hold on.<|endoftext|>
|0| No! Argh.<|endoftext|>
|0| I think I liked it best when they were being noisy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Mmm hmm. Doctor, we need you. Get over here.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| Cybermats.<|endoftext|>
|0| Do we have time for this?<|endoftext|>
|1| We make time. I'd like more proof that you're me. Cybermats.<|endoftext|>
|0| Created by the Cybermen. They kill by feeding off brainwaves.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you sure there aren't any weapons to can get to, like big gunswith bits on?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, big guns would be good right now.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why would we have guns? We're a factory. We mine.<|endoftext|>
|0| Acid.<|endoftext|>
|1| Rory and Amy, they may not trust both of us.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you thinking what I'm thinking?<|endoftext|>
|1| Inevitably.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm glad we're on the same<|endoftext|>
|1| Wavelength. You see, great minds.<|endoftext|>
|0| Exactly. So, what's the plan?<|endoftext|>
|1| Save them all, humans and gangers.<|endoftext|>
|0| Tall order. Sounds wonderful.<|endoftext|>
|1| Is that what you were thinking? It's just so inspiring to hearme say it.<|endoftext|>
|0| I know.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, come on.<|endoftext|>
|0| So, what now, Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, time to get cracking, Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello. Sorry, but we had to establish a few ground rules.<|endoftext|>
|1| Formulate a protocol.<|endoftext|>
|0| Protocol? Very posh.<|endoftext|>
|1| A protocol between us. Otherwise<|endoftext|>
|0| It gets horribly embarrassing.<|endoftext|>
|1| And potentially confusing.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm glad you've solved the problem of confusing.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's sarcasm.<|endoftext|>
|1| She's very good at sarcasm.<|endoftext|>
|0| Breathe.<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|1| We have to get you off this island. And the Gangers too.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry, would you like a memo from the last meeting? They aretrying to kill us!<|endoftext|>
|1| They're scared.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, we're trapped in here.<|endoftext|>
|1| Right, See, I don't think so. The Flesh Bowl is fed by cablingfrom above.<|endoftext|>
|0| But where are the earthing conduits?<|endoftext|>
|1| All this piping must go down into a tunnel or a shaft orsomething, yes? With us?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yowza. An escape route.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yowza?<|endoftext|>
|1| You know, I'm starting to get a sense of just how impressive itis to hang out with me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Do we tend to say yowza?<|endoftext|>
|1| That's enough, let it go, okay? We're under stress.<|endoftext|>
|0| Stop. Stop. Stop, stop.<|endoftext|>
|0| The army will send a recon team our.<|endoftext|>
|0| We need to find a way to contact the mainland.<|endoftext|>
|0| What about Rory and Jen? They are both out there.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, this place is a maze. Takes a long time to find someone ina maze. I bet you lot have got a computer map, haven't you?<|endoftext|>
|0| If we can get power running, we can scan for them. Be a lotquicker.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, you said earlier to breathe.<|endoftext|>
|1| Very important, Pond. Breathe.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, well, I'm struggling to.<|endoftext|>
|1| Acid interacting with the stone.<|endoftext|>
|0| Creating an asphyxiant miasma.<|endoftext|>
|0| A what?<|endoftext|>
|1| Choking gas. Extra heavy. If we can get above it.<|endoftext|>
|0| The evac tower. It's this way.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, damned headaches. I'm so tired.<|endoftext|>
|0| They could be anywhere. How are we going to find them?<|endoftext|>
|0| Think about it. With all that gas out there, my guess wouldbe the evac tower. Get above it, try to get power up.<|endoftext|>
|0| So? Let's stop them.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's a narrow doorway. I could defend it easy enough. So canshe. Ow.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh. I think I coughed so hard, I pulled amuscle or something. It's okay, it's better. It's easing off.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's midnight. It's Adam's birthday. My son's five. Happybirthday, bud.<|endoftext|>
|0| Happy birthday, Adam. He'll be so excited.Out of bed at the crack of dawn. It's funny, he's got this wee dance hedoes when he gets over-excited.<|endoftext|>
|0| Listen to me. I tried to block the memories, but now I knowI must remember. It's the eyes. The eyes are the last to go.<|endoftext|>
|0| What are you talking about?<|endoftext|>
|0| When they destroy us, the eyes are the last things to melt.And there's one question in those eyes. Why? Why should we suffer forthe sake of human beings?<|endoftext|>
|0| I heard in India there's over ten million Gangers.<|endoftext|>
|0| We can reach out. Inspire them to rise up.<|endoftext|>
|0| Revolution? Look, I just, I just want to be left to live inpeace, Jen.<|endoftext|>
|0| They will melt you. Have you become so human that you'veforgotten the truth? Don't you remember all the times you weredecommissioned, or should I say executed?<|endoftext|>
|0| No, we don't remember.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, I do. It's us or them.<|endoftext|>
|0| She's right.<|endoftext|>
|0| I have a plan, and it'll destroy them all.<|endoftext|>
|0| Can you really get the power back?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, there's always some power floating around.<|endoftext|>
|1| Sticking to the wires, like bits of lint.<|endoftext|>
|0| Can you stop finishing each other's<|endoftext|>
|1| Sentences? No probs.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, hang on. You said that the Tardis was stuck in acid, so won'tshe be damaged?<|endoftext|>
|1| Nah, she's a tough old thing. Tough, old, sexy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Tough, dependable, sexy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Come on. Okay, how can how can you both be real?<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, because we are. I'm the Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah and so am I. We both contain the knowledge of over ninehundred years of memory and experience.<|endoftext|>
|1| We both wear the same bow tie, which is cool.<|endoftext|>
|0| Because bow ties are<|endoftext|>
|1| And always will be.<|endoftext|>
|0| But how did the Flesh read you? Because you weren't linked up tothe it.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, it must've been after I examined it. Thus, a new, genuineDoctor was created.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ta-da.<|endoftext|>
|0| No getting away from it. One of you was here first.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, okay. After the Flesh scanned me, I had an accident witha puddle of acid. Now, new shoes. A situation which did not confront melearned self here.<|endoftext|>
|0| That satisfy you, Pond?<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't call me Pond, please. What?<|endoftext|>
|0| Interesting. You definitely feel more affection for him thanme.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, no, I. Look, you're fine and everything, but he's the Doctor.No offence. Being almost the Doctor is pretty damn impressive.<|endoftext|>
|0| Being almost the Doctor's like being no Doctor at all.<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't overreact.<|endoftext|>
|0| You might as well call me Smith.<|endoftext|>
|0| Smith?<|endoftext|>
|0| John Smith.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes! Communication a go-go.<|endoftext|>
|0| Find Rory! Show me the scanning tracking screen. Come on, Rory,let's be having you.<|endoftext|>
|0| There's no sign of him anywhere.<|endoftext|>
|0| Come on. Come on, baby, show yourself.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're right, there's power.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, boys, I don't know much, but I know my own minds.She'll be straight on the comlink to the mainland.<|endoftext|>
|0| Saint John's calling. Emergency Alpha.<|endoftext|>
|0| Let's see if we can intercept.<|endoftext|>
|0| Saint John's calling the mainland. Are you receiving me,Captain? Come in.<|endoftext|>
|0| We'll never get a signal through thisstorm. Saint John's calling the mainland. Come in, this is urgent.<|endoftext|>
|0| We're just about reading you, Saint John's. How are youdoing? We've had all kinds of trouble here.<|endoftext|>
|0| Request immediate evacuation. We'reunder attack. The storm's affected our Gangers.<|endoftext|>
|0| They're running amok.<|endoftext|>
|0| Your Gangers?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, our Gangers are attacking us. We need you to take us offthe island immediately and wipe them out.<|endoftext|>
|0| Copy that, Saint John's. Shuttle'sdespatched. Hang on.<|endoftext|>
|0| You'll need to airlift us off the roof ofthe evac tower.<|endoftext|>
|0| And Captain, any further transmissionsent by me must come with the following codeword. I'm typing it, incase they're listening in.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oof. See how smart I am? That's why I'm paid the big bucks.<|endoftext|>
|0| Got it. We'll swing in, get you out and decommission theFlesh.<|endoftext|>
|0| Jennifer's right. We're going to have to fight if we want tosurvive.<|endoftext|>
|0| Thermostatic override rejected. Can only be operated byrecognised source.<|endoftext|>
|0| I am recognised. I'm Jennifer Lucas.<|endoftext|>
|0| We've got to get out of here. We are, we'regoing to get out.<|endoftext|>
|0| We're not leaving without them.<|endoftext|>
|0| I want them found too, but it's about casualties, innit? Can'tbe helped.<|endoftext|>
|0| What are you doing?<|endoftext|>
|1| Making a phone call.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who to?<|endoftext|>
|1| No one yet. It's on delay.<|endoftext|>
|0| Right. Not getting it. Why exactly are you making a phone call?<|endoftext|>
|1| Because, Amy, I am and always will be the optimist. The hoperof far-flung hopes and the dreamer of improbable dreams. The wheels arein motion. Done.<|endoftext|>
|0| You know really there can be only one.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hmm?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, nothing. Carry on. Be amazing.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy? What happened?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's her again.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's who again?<|endoftext|>
|0| There's a woman I keep seeing. A woman with an eyepatch, and shehas this habit of sliding walls open and staring at me. Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's nothing.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doesn't seem like nothing.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's a time memory. Like a mirage. It's nothing to worry about.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's in my head.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hey, hold on.<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't let him go.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, leave it to me.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm sorry. What I said about you being almostthe Doctor, it's just really hard, because I've been through so muchwith him. I've even seen. I've even seen the moment of his. Can youdie? If you really are the same, then you can die. You can be killed,and I might have seen that happen.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why?<|endoftext|>
|0| Why? Because you invited us to see it. Your death.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why?<|endoftext|>
|0| You're hurting me.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's all the eyes say. Why? I can feel them as they work eachday, knowing the time was coming for them to be thrown away again. Notagain, please. And then they are destroyed and they feel death, and allthey can say is, why?<|endoftext|>
|1| Why?<|endoftext|>
|0| Keep him away from me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Did you sense it?<|endoftext|>
|1| Briefly. Not as strong as you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy, I'm sorry.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, you keep away. We can't trust you.<|endoftext|>
|0| It would appear I can connect to the Flesh.<|endoftext|>
|0| You are Flesh.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm beginning to understand what it's been through, what itneeds.<|endoftext|>
|0| What you want. You are it.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's much more powerful than we thought. The Flesh can grow,correct?<|endoftext|>
|0| Its cells can divide.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, now it wants to do that at will. It wants revenge. It'sin pain, angry. It wants revenge.<|endoftext|>
|0| I was right. You're not the Doctor. You can't ever be. You're justa copy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, it might be best if you stayed over there for now,hmm?<|endoftext|>
|1| Hold on a minute, hold your horses. I thought I'd explainedthis. I'm him, he's me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, we have no issue with you, but when it comes to yourGanger<|endoftext|>
|1| Don't be so absurd.<|endoftext|>
|0| Buzzer.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sure, boss.<|endoftext|>
|0| Take a seat, mate.<|endoftext|>
|0| Nice barrel, very comfy. Why not? Is this really what youwant?<|endoftext|>
|0| Help me. No, get away.<|endoftext|>
|0| Jen? Jen?<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm sorry. She found me. Rory, listen to me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't listen to her.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm Jennifer Lucas. This woman is Flesh.<|endoftext|>
|0| This is the shuttle. We're right aboveyou, but we can't get low enough. Gamma static could fry ournav-controls. Sit tight. We'll get to you. Just<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello? Can you hear me?<|endoftext|>
|0| I can't find Rory. I'm going out there.<|endoftext|>
|1| We could use the sonic to track him. Humans and Gangers giveoff slightly different signals. The sonic needs to tell the difference.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, so the sonic knows Gangers are different. The other Doctor isdifferent.<|endoftext|>
|1| He is the Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Not to me. I can tell.<|endoftext|>
|1| Sure you're not prejudiced?<|endoftext|>
|0| Nice try, but I know, okay? We've been through too much. You're myDoctor. End of.<|endoftext|>
|0| So one of you is human, and one of you I satwith and talked with. Why can't you just tell me the truth? The Doctorwants you to live, and I'm with him all the way.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's a lovely idea, Rory, but the Flesh want to kill usnow.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're limping. You're not.<|endoftext|>
|0| So? So what? You think a Ganger can't put on a limp?<|endoftext|>
|0| Show me your leg.<|endoftext|>
|0| It got burnt while I was in the harness.<|endoftext|>
|0| She's lying. She's telling you what you want to hear.<|endoftext|>
|0| But look, you can't fake a burn.<|endoftext|>
|0| No! No, you don't. Stop it. Stop it! Fighting each other ispointless. Come on. Please, please stop. Jen. Both Jens, stop it. No!<|endoftext|>
|0| She, she attacked me. I knew you'd find me. We're in thistogether, Rory, and we've got to trust each other.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay. Come on, let's go.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hey, there's a camera up. We've got avisual.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's Rory and Jennifer.<|endoftext|>
|0| They're heading for the thermostatic room.<|endoftext|>
|0| Let's go get them.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hang on.<|endoftext|>
|0| We can't let him go. Are you crazy?<|endoftext|>
|1| Am I crazy, Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, you did want to plumb your brain into the core of anentire planet just to halt its orbit and win a bet.<|endoftext|>
|0| He can't go rescue them. I'm going.<|endoftext|>
|1| Do you know, I want him to go. And I'm rather adamant.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well then, he'll need company. Right, boss? It's fine. I'llhandle it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Thank you, Buzzer. It'll be all right. I'll find him.<|endoftext|>
|1| Can't explain it to you now, but I need you to trust him. Canyou do that for me, Amy?<|endoftext|>
|0| And what if you're wrong?<|endoftext|>
|0| This is the thermostatic chamber. We canstir the oxygen supply from here.<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|0| We're going to choke to death if we don't clean this air.Keep a look out in case of Gangers. Rory!<|endoftext|>
|0| What's wrong?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's this wheel. It's just too tough for a girl to turn. Areyou feeling strong?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'll break out the big guns.<|endoftext|>
|0| This first.<|endoftext|>
|0| Human source recognised.<|endoftext|>
|0| Thermostatic override granted.<|endoftext|>
|0| These temperature gauges are rising.Jennifer and Rory must have shut off the underground cooling vents.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why do that? They'll kill us.<|endoftext|>
|0| There's a million gallons of boiling acid under our feet.<|endoftext|>
|1| And now it's heating up the whole island. How long till itblows?<|endoftext|>
|0| Gangers or no Gangers, we need to get the hell out of here.<|endoftext|>
|0| Shuttle, we need evac. Where are you? Can you hear me? Can you<|endoftext|>
|1| Cleaves? Cleaves? Cleaves, sit down.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm fine.<|endoftext|>
|0| You don't look good.<|endoftext|>
|0| Monsters never do. I'm fine. I remember medics doing tests.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm waiting for results, so let it go.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's a very deep parietal clot.<|endoftext|>
|0| How can you possibly? Inoperable?<|endoftext|>
|1| On Earth, yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, seeing as Earth's all that's on offer. Hmm. I'm nohealthy spring chicken, and you're no weatherman. Right?<|endoftext|>
|0| Something just cracked. I heard it.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, we can't stay here. Let's go.<|endoftext|>
|0| He's right. Let's shift.<|endoftext|>
|0| Cleaves to Shuttle. Respond. We need to move, and we can't becollected from the Evac tower.<|endoftext|>
|0| Give us the codeword.<|endoftext|>
|0| The codeword is<|endoftext|>
|1| Cleaves? Cleaves, it's dead. It's dead. We need to get out ofhere. We need to get back downstairs and get those vents back on. Comeon.<|endoftext|>
|0| This is our chance. I can reroute theshuttle to the courtyard.<|endoftext|>
|0| You can't guess the codeword.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, I can, Jimmy, because I created the codeword. Shuttle,do you read me? This is Foreman Cleaves.<|endoftext|>
|0| Read you. You got cut off. Say again. What's the request?<|endoftext|>
|0| You need to reroute and pick us up from the courtyard.<|endoftext|>
|0| Courtyard. As soon as we can. Give me the codeword.<|endoftext|>
|0| Shuttle, the codeword is Bad Boy. I repeat, Bad Boy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Copy that. The courtyard. Still want us to take care ofthose Gangers?<|endoftext|>
|0| Negative. They've all been incinerated.<|endoftext|>
|0| Bad Boy? Good call.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, well, it wasn't luck. We're the same person.<|endoftext|>
|0| This room's always sealed. Power surgemust have thrown the bolts.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is that?<|endoftext|>
|0| Discarded Flesh. Faulty, probably. Just thrown away. Look atthem. One of my old Gangers.<|endoftext|>
|0| Left to rot, fully conscious. Can you imagine what kind ofhell they're in?<|endoftext|>
|0| But Cleaves, the Company, how could they do this? How could they?<|endoftext|>
|0| Who are the real monsters?<|endoftext|>
|0| We can't let this carry on. Jen, we have to make people see.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, Rory. I have an idea. You came for me. We have a bond,right? We trust each other.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah.<|endoftext|>
|0| So trust me on this.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm getting something.<|endoftext|>
|0| Is it human?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, it's human, but it's fading. It's fading. This is bad.Fading is very bad. Argh. The signal's gone. She's dead.<|endoftext|>
|0| She was hanging onto the edge of life and she just, justslipped away. Oh, Jennifer, I'm so sorry. She's been out here forhours.<|endoftext|>
|0| But if the real Jen's been lying out here?<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory's in trouble.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry, pal. it's boss's orders. Us and them, innit?<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah. The eyes have it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why are they here?<|endoftext|>
|1| To accuse us.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ignore them. It's not far.<|endoftext|>
|0| I should have been a postman like me dad.<|endoftext|>
|0| Shush. I'm here. I'm here. I'm with you. I know, ithurts. I'm sorry. Go to sleep. Sleep.<|endoftext|>
|0| You killed her. You killed our Jen.<|endoftext|>
|0| And I'm stronger, Buzz. I can grow.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's a chemical chain reaction now. I can'tstop it. This place is going to blow sky high.<|endoftext|>
|0| Exactly how long have we got?<|endoftext|>
|1| An hour? Five seconds? Er, somewhere in between.<|endoftext|>
|1| Out!<|endoftext|>
|0| Thank God. All right?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, Rory. Oh, Rory.<|endoftext|>
|0| There's a way out. Jennifer found it. A secret tunnel under thecrypt.<|endoftext|>
|0| From the crypt? It's not on the schematics.<|endoftext|>
|0| It runs right out of the monastery. Maybe even under the Tardis,Doctor. Follow me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Got anything for a sore head?<|endoftext|>
|0| This is how they'll always treat us. Do you see now? Afterall, you're one of us, Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Call me Smith. John Smith.<|endoftext|>
|0| We can't leave without Buzzer.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'll go back for him.<|endoftext|>
|0| Er, Doctor, look. I'd better tell you. I haven't been quitestraight with you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Rory!<|endoftext|>
|0| Hang on, Jen. We don't need to lock them up. We should just showthem what we've found.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't think so.<|endoftext|>
|1| Rory Pond, Roranicus Pondicus!<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory, What the hell are you playing at?<|endoftext|>
|0| They've been throwing away old Flesh and leaving it to rot.Alive. I think the world should see that.<|endoftext|>
|1| Rory, there is no time. The factory's about to explode.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you sure about this? Because I'm not. Let them out.<|endoftext|>
|0| The little girl got strong.<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|0| The little girl lost on the moors in her red wellies,looking for a way home? Well, she got strong, Rory. I told you,remember?<|endoftext|>
|0| But that wasn't. It was the other Jennifer that told me aboutbeing a little girl.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh? What other Jennifer?<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, the, the er. Wait, you tricked me? Let me go. I'm openingthe door. Let me. I'm sorry!<|endoftext|>
|0| No!<|endoftext|>
|0| We have to be free.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm sorry too, Miranda. Of all the humans in the world, youhad to pick the one with the clot. But hey, them's the breaks. Welcometo the human race.<|endoftext|>
|1| This is going to overheat and fill the room with acid, just asa point of interest.<|endoftext|>
|0| And we can't stop it?<|endoftext|>
|1| Just as a point of interest? No.<|endoftext|>
|0| You created another Ganger just to trick me.You tricked me. When I found you, you were both Flesh and you trickedme into trusting you. Jen's dead, isn't she?<|endoftext|>
|0| She's gone, Rory. Gone.<|endoftext|>
|0| Shuttle. We're dropping down on our approach. Stand by forevac.<|endoftext|>
|0| The humans will be melted, as they deserve, and then thefactory will be destroyed. Once we get to the mainland, the real battlebegins. The humans won't stand a chance. You're one of us, Doctor. Jointhe revolution.<|endoftext|>
|0| I've got to go and get them out.<|endoftext|>
|0| It'll never hold her.<|endoftext|>
|1| If you have a better plan, I'm all ears. In fact, if you have abetter plan, I'll take you to a planet where everyone is all ears.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, we can't just let them die.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ring, ring.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|0| Ring, ring.<|endoftext|>
|0| The acid's eating through.<|endoftext|>
|0| Stay.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ah, that'll be the phone. Somebody get the phone. Jimmy, getthe phone. No? Fine, I'll get the phone. Stay put.<|endoftext|>
|0| Thank you for booking your holo-call with Morpeth Jetsan,bringing the world together.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ha! Hello, Adam, I'm the Doctor. Well, other Doctor. OrSmith. It's complicated and boring. Anyway, who cares. It's yourbirthday.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yay.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yay. Now, have you been getting up very early and jumping onthe bed?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, really high.<|endoftext|>
|0| I expect chocolate for breakfast. If you don't feel sick bymid-morning, you're not doing it right. Now, I think you want to speakto Dad.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Daddy?<|endoftext|>
|0| You'll do, Jimmy. What does the other Jimmy matter now?You're both the same dad, aren't you? Come on, Adam's waiting.<|endoftext|>
|0| Daddy? Daddy, what's that rumbly noise? What's going on, Daddy?Daddy?<|endoftext|>
|0| You've tricked him into an act of weakness, Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, I've helped him into an act of humanity. Anyone else likethe sound of that? Act of humanity.<|endoftext|>
|0| Dicken, drain the acid well in Crypt One.<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't you dare.<|endoftext|>
|0| I've had it with this. What's the point in this ridiculouswar? Look at you, Jen. You were a sweet kid. Look at you now. The stuffof nightmares. I don't want my world populated by monsters.<|endoftext|>
|0| You can't stop the factory from melting down, boss. I'lltake revenge on humanity with or without you.<|endoftext|>
|0| It doesn't have to be about revenge. It can be so much betterthan that.<|endoftext|>
|0| Argh.<|endoftext|>
|0| Let me through.<|endoftext|>
|1| There's nothing we can do. The acid's reached his heart.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hang in there, mate.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm quite handsome from this angle.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm sorry. I'm the fake. Adam deserves his real dad.<|endoftext|>
|0| Shut up.<|endoftext|>
|0| What do you want me to do? Anything. Just say.<|endoftext|>
|0| The way things are, mate, it's up to you now. Be a dad. Youremember how.<|endoftext|>
|1| Jimmy Wicks, you're a dad.<|endoftext|>
|0| Daddy? Where's my daddy?<|endoftext|>
|0| Daddy, it's me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hey, sunshine. What are you up to?<|endoftext|>
|0| Opening all my presents.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ha ha, good lad. You have fun today. And remember your dad, heloves you very, very much.<|endoftext|>
|0| When are you coming home?<|endoftext|>
|1| Daddy's coming home today, Adam.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yay.<|endoftext|>
|1| Now we need to move.<|endoftext|>
|1| Run. Run. Run! Ooo, roof's going to give. <|endoftext|>
|0| We have to stop her. This door doesn't lock.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, but the far one does.<|endoftext|>
|0| Argh.<|endoftext|>
|0| No!<|endoftext|>
|0| Here she comes.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, she does like to make an entrance.<|endoftext|>
|1| Everyone move.<|endoftext|>
|0| Go. Go, go, go.<|endoftext|>
|0| Get on board. Go. <|endoftext|>
|0| I'm not leaving.<|endoftext|>
|0| Go.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hey, hey. Now's our chance.<|endoftext|>
|0| I have to stay. Hold this door closed. Give you time todematerialise.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, don't be crazy. Okay, what happens to you?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, this place is just about to explode. But I can stop her.<|endoftext|>
|0| Both of you can survive this, okay? There has to be a way.<|endoftext|>
|1| Or perhaps you think I should stay instead? Mister Smith.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, of course not. But look, this man, I've flown with him, youknow? And you are amazing and yeah, I misjudged you, but you're nothim. I'm sorry.<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy, we swapped shoes.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm the Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| And I'm the Flesh.<|endoftext|>
|0| You can't be. You're the real him.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, I'm not, and I haven't been all along.<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm the original Doctor, Amy. We had to know if we were trulythe same. It was important, vital we learn about The Flesh, and wecould only do that through your eyes.<|endoftext|>
|0| I never thought it possible.<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|0| You're twice the man I thought you were.<|endoftext|>
|0| Push, Amy. But only when she tells you to.<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy, come on!<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, my death arrives, I suppose.<|endoftext|>
|1| But this one, we're not invited to.<|endoftext|>
|0| Pardon?<|endoftext|>
|1| Nothing. Your molecular memory can survive this, you know. Itmay not be the end.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, well, if I turn up to nick all your biscuits, thenyou'll know you were right, won't you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor! No, please.<|endoftext|>
|0| You too, Cleaves. Off you pop.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm staying.<|endoftext|>
|0| This is not the time for grand gestures.<|endoftext|>
|0| Says the king of grand gestures. This is my factory. I'm notgoing anywhere.<|endoftext|>
|0| Foreman Miranda Cleaves, marvellous. Beware of imitations.<|endoftext|>
|0| Clear off out of here, the lot of you.<|endoftext|>
|0| This will dissolve her.<|endoftext|>
|0| And us too.<|endoftext|>
|0| There may be a way back from this.<|endoftext|>
|0| From being vaporised? How?<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't know. Let's find out, eh?<|endoftext|>
|1| Geronimo.<|endoftext|>
|1| The energy from the Tardis will stabilisethe Gangers for good. They're people now.<|endoftext|>
|0| And what happens to me? I still have this.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah, that's not a problem. I have something for that. It's smalland red and tastes like burnt onions. Ha. But it'll get rid of yourblood clot.<|endoftext|>
|1| Happy endings.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hey! Hello, bud. <|endoftext|>
|0| Daddy, you're back.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello, my boy. How are you doing?<|endoftext|>
|0| You really want us to do this?<|endoftext|>
|1| Your company's telling the world that the situation is over.You need to get in there and tell them that the situation's only justbegun. Make them understand what they're doing to the Flesh. Make themstop. Dicken, remember, people are good. In their bones, truly good.Don't hate them, will you?<|endoftext|>
|0| How can I hate them? I'm one of them now.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah. And just remember, people died. Don't let that be invain. Make what you say in that room count.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ready? Side by side.<|endoftext|>
|0| You got it, boss.<|endoftext|>
|0| Have the army dealt with the imposters, sir?<|endoftext|>
|0| What sort of threat is there to the public?<|endoftext|>
|0| You okay?<|endoftext|>
|1| I said breathe, Pond. Remember? Well, breathe.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why?<|endoftext|>
|1| Breathe.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh!<|endoftext|>
|0| Whoa.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's wrong with her?<|endoftext|>
|1| Get her into the Tardis.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor! What is happening to her?<|endoftext|>
|1| Contractions.<|endoftext|>
|0| Contractions?<|endoftext|>
|1| She's going into labour.<|endoftext|>
|0| Did he say? No. No, no. Of course he didn't. Rory, I don't likethis. Ow.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're going to have to start explaining some of this to me,Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| What, the birds and the bees? She's having a baby. I needed tosee the Flesh in its early days. That's why I scanned it. That's why wewere there in the first place. I was going to drop you off for fish andchips first, but things happened and there was stuff and shenanigans.Beautiful word, shenanigans.<|endoftext|>
|0| It hurts.<|endoftext|>
|0| But you're okay?<|endoftext|>
|1| Breathe. I needed enough information to block the signal to theFlesh.<|endoftext|>
|0| What signal?<|endoftext|>
|1| The signal to you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor. Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| Stand away from her, Rory.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why? No. And why?<|endoftext|>
|1| Given what we've learned, I'll be as humane as I can, but Ineed to do this and you need to stand away!<|endoftext|>
|0| No. No. Doctor, I am frightened. I'm properly, properly scared.<|endoftext|>
|1| Don't be. Hold on. We're coming for you. I swear it. Whateverhappens, however hard, however far, we will find you.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm right here.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, you're not. You haven't been here for a long, long time.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, no.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, dear, you're ready to pop, aren't you? Littleone's on its way. Here it comes. Push!<|endoftext|>
|0| I wish I could tell you that you'll be loved, that you'll be safeand cared for and protected. But this isn't a time for lies. What youare going to be, Melody is very, very brave.<|endoftext|>
|0| Two minutes.<|endoftext|>
|0| But not as brave as they'll have to be. Because there's someonecoming. I don't know where he is, or what he's doing, but trust me,he's on his way.<|endoftext|>
|0| Intruder level nine.<|endoftext|>
|0| Seal level nine.<|endoftext|>
|0| There's a man who's never going to let usdown, and not even an army can get in the way.<|endoftext|>
|0| Leave her. Just you leave her. Please leave her! Please, leaveher!<|endoftext|>
|0| Intruder level eleven.<|endoftext|>
|0| Seal levels twelve, thirteen and fourteen.<|endoftext|>
|0| Intruder, level fifteen.<|endoftext|>
|0| He's the last of his kind. He looks young, but he's lived forhundreds and hundreds of years. And wherever they take you, Melody,however scared you are, I promise you, you will never be alone. Becausethis man is your father.<|endoftext|>
|0| Prepare to engage.<|endoftext|>
|0| He has a name, but the people of our worldknow him better<|endoftext|>
|0| As the Last Centurion.<|endoftext|>
|0| I have a message and a question. A message from the Doctor and aquestion from me. Where is my wife? Oh, don't give me those blanklooks. The Twelfth Cyber Legion monitors this entire quadrant. You heareverything. So you tell me what I need to know. You tell me now, andI'll be on my way.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is the Doctor's message?<|endoftext|>
|0| Would you like me to repeat the question?<|endoftext|>
|0| A whole Cyber Legion though. He just blew them all up to make apoint.<|endoftext|>
|0| We're being paid to fight him, not praise him. Praisingcosts way more.<|endoftext|>
|0| Level Minus Twenty Three Transept.<|endoftext|>

|0| Did somebody call for a nurse?<|endoftext|>
|0| Will I be okay?<|endoftext|>
|0| Of course you will, my boy. You'll be up and around in no time.And perhaps one day, you and I shall meet on the field of battle, and Iwill destroy you for the glory of the Sontaran Empire.<|endoftext|>
|0| Thanks, Nurse.<|endoftext|>
|0| Commander Strax. I just have to ask. A Sontaran nurse?<|endoftext|>
|0| I serve a penance to restore the honour of my clone batch. It isthe greatest punishment a Sontaran can endure, to help the weak andsick.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who came up with that one?<|endoftext|>
|0| Tonight, though, perhaps my penance is over. Captain Harcourt, Ihope some day to meet you in the glory of battle, when I shall crushthe life from your worthless human form. Try and get some rest.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, turn it off. I'm breaking in, not out. This is River Song,back in her cell. Oh, and I'll take breakfast at the usual time. Thankyou.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, are you boys dressing up as Romans now? I thought nobodyread my memos.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor Song. It's Rory. Sorry, have we met yet? Time streams. I'mnot quite sure where we are.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes. Yes, we've met. Hello, Rory.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's wrong?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's my birthday. The Doctor took me ice skating on the RiverThames in 1814, the last of the great Frost Fairs. He got Stevie Wonderto sing for me under London Bridge.<|endoftext|>
|0| Stevie Wonder sang in 1814?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, he did. But you must never tell him.<|endoftext|>
|0| I've come from the Doctor too.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, but at a different point in time.<|endoftext|>
|0| Unless there's two of them.<|endoftext|>
|0| Now, that's a whole different birthday.<|endoftext|>
|0| He needs you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Demon's Run.<|endoftext|>
|0| How, how did you know?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm from his future. I always know. Why on Earth are you wearingthat?<|endoftext|>
|0| The Doctor's idea.<|endoftext|>
|0| Of course. His rules of engagement. Float like a butterfly,sting like a bee.<|endoftext|>
|0| Look ridiculous.<|endoftext|>
|0| Have you considered heels?<|endoftext|>
|0| They've taken Amy. And our baby. The Doctor's getting some peopletogether. We're going after her, but he needs you, too.<|endoftext|>
|0| I can't. Not yet, anyway.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm sorry?<|endoftext|>
|0| This is the Battle of Demon's Run. The Doctor's darkest hour.He'll rise higher than ever before and then fall so much further, and Ican't be with him till the very end.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why not?<|endoftext|>
|0| Because this is it. This is the day he finds out who I am.<|endoftext|>
|0| Goodbye.<|endoftext|>
|0| You appear to be closing down, Dorium. What have you heard?<|endoftext|>
|0| That you pricked the side of a mighty beast, Madame Kovarian,and entirely failed to run. I admire your courage. I should like toadmire it from afar.<|endoftext|>
|0| We've been waiting a month. He's done nothing.<|endoftext|>
|0| Do you really think so? There are people all over this galaxythat owe that man a debt. By now, a few of them will have found a bluebox waiting for them on their doorstep, poor devils.<|endoftext|>
|0| You think he's raising an army?<|endoftext|>
|0| You think he isn't? If that man is finally collecting on hisdebts, God help you, and God help his debtors.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why?<|endoftext|>
|0| Colonel Manton, all those stories you've heard about him,they're not stories, they're true. Really. You're not telling me youdon't know what's coming?<|endoftext|>
|0| We're wasting our time here.<|endoftext|>
|0| Agreed.<|endoftext|>
|0| The asteroid, where you've made your base. Do you know why theycall it Demon's Run?<|endoftext|>
|0| How do you know the location of our base?<|endoftext|>
|0| You're with the Headless Monks. They're old customers of mine.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's just some old saying.<|endoftext|>
|0| A very old saying. The oldest. Demons run when a good man goesto war.<|endoftext|>
|0| No. No, no, please. Not me. You don't need me. Why would youneed me? I'm old, I'm fat, I'm blue. You can't need me!<|endoftext|>
|0| He is not the devil. He is not a god. He is not a goblin, or aphantom or a trickster. The Doctor is a living, breathing man, and as Ilook around this room I know one thing. We're sure as hell going to fixthat.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry. I shouldn't be here. I'm meant to be at the thing. Ibrought you something. Your child's name in the language of my people.It's a prayer leaf and we believe, if you keep this with you, yourchild will always come home to you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Can I borrow your gun?<|endoftext|>
|0| Why?<|endoftext|>
|0| Because I've got a feeling you're going to keep talking.<|endoftext|>
|0| They're talking like he's famous. The Doctor isn't famous.<|endoftext|>
|0| He meets a lot of people. Some of them remember. He's sort oflike a, I don'tknow, a dark legend.<|endoftext|>
|0| Dark? Have you met him?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah. But I was just a little girl.<|endoftext|>
|0| So was I.<|endoftext|>
|0| You've been with him a long time, then.<|endoftext|>
|0| No. He came back for me.<|endoftext|>
|0| You must be very special.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hey. You can wait a long time for the Doctor, but he's worth it,okay? The thing is, he's coming. No question about it. Just you makesure you're on the right side when he gets here. Not for my sake, foryours.<|endoftext|>
|0| Thank you.<|endoftext|>
|0| On this day, in this place, the Doctor willfall.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hoo Rah!<|endoftext|>
|0| The man who talks, the man who reasons, the man who lies, willmeet the perfect answer.<|endoftext|>
|0| They never can be afraid.<|endoftext|>
|0| And they can never, ever be<|endoftext|>
|1| Surprised! Ha, ha! Hello, everyone. Guess who. Please, point agun at me if it helps you relax.<|endoftext|>
|1| You're only human.<|endoftext|>
|0| Go on, resist. I am ever so hungry.<|endoftext|>
|0| Now, dear. Which button controls the lights?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, you will come with me right now.<|endoftext|>
|1| Three minutes forty seconds. Amelia Pond! Get your coat!<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm not a phantom.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm not a trick.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm a monk.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, show yourself.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's him! He's here! It's him!<|endoftext|>
|0| Weapons down! Do not fire!<|endoftext|>
|0| No!<|endoftext|>
|0| Follow me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor! Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|0| Clever, isn't he?<|endoftext|>
|0| And rather attractive.<|endoftext|>
|0| You do realise he's a man, don't you, ma'am?<|endoftext|>
|0| Mammals. They all look alike.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, thank you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Do not fire. Nobody discharge their weaponin this room. Nobody! Do not fire!<|endoftext|>
|0| Was I being insensitive again, dear? I don't know why you putup with me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Stop. Wait. Listen to me. I am disarming myweapon pack. Monks, I do this in good faith. I am now unarmed. All ofyou, discharge your weapon packs. The Doctor is trying to make fools ofus. We are soldiers of God. We are not fools. We are not fools. We arenot fools. We are not fools.<|endoftext|>
|0| We are not fools!<|endoftext|>
|0| We are not fools.<|endoftext|>
|0| We are not fools.<|endoftext|>
|0| We are not fools.<|endoftext|>
|0| We are not fools.<|endoftext|>
|0| Colonel Manton is regaining control.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where's the Doctor gone?<|endoftext|>
|0| We are not fools. We are not fools. We are not fools.<|endoftext|>
|0| This base is now under our command.<|endoftext|>
|0| I have a fleet out there. If Demon's Run goes down, there's anautomatic distress call.<|endoftext|>
|0| Not if we knock out your communications array. And you'vegot incoming.<|endoftext|>
|0| Danny Boy to the Doctor. Danny Boy to the Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| Give 'em hell, Danny Boy.<|endoftext|>
|0| I need to get off this station now. Bringme the child!<|endoftext|>
|0| Target destroyed.<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't slump. It's bad for your spine.<|endoftext|>
|0| Get back in there with the rest of them. Remember, the Doctormust think he's winning, right until the trap closes. I'll take my shipfrom here.<|endoftext|>
|0| Airlock engaged. Shuttle ready for boarding.<|endoftext|>
|0| No.<|endoftext|>
|0| I have a crew of twenty. How do you expect to gain control ofmy ship?<|endoftext|>
|0| This ship is ours, milady.<|endoftext|>
|0| All airlocks sealed. Resistance neutralised.<|endoftext|>
|1| Sorry, Colonel Manton. I lied. Three minutes forty two seconds.<|endoftext|>
|0| Colonel Manton, you will give the order for your men towithdraw.<|endoftext|>
|1| No. Colonel Manton, I want you to tell your men to run away.<|endoftext|>
|0| You what?<|endoftext|>
|1| Those words. Run away. I want you to be famous for those exactwords. I want people to call you Colonel Run Away. I want childrenlaughing outside your door, because they've found the house of ColonelRun Away. And, when people come to you, and ask if trying to get to methrough the people I love is in any way a good idea, I want you to tellthem your name. Oh, look, I'm angry. That's new. I'm really not surewhat's going to happen now.<|endoftext|>
|0| The anger of a good man is not a problem. Good men have toomany rules.<|endoftext|>
|1| Good men don't need rules. Today is not the day to find out whyI have so many.<|endoftext|>
|0| Give the order. Give the order, Colonel Run Away.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who's that? Who's there? You watch it, because I'm armed andreally dangerous, and cross.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, like I don't know that.<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory? Rory, is that you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, it's me. Look, hang on a minute.<|endoftext|>
|0| They took her. Rory, they took our baby away.<|endoftext|>
|0| Now, Mrs Williams, that is never, ever going to happen.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Where's she been? What have they done toher?<|endoftext|>
|0| She's fine. Amy, she's fine. I checked. She's beautiful. Oh God,I was going to be cool. I wanted to be cool. Look at me.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're okay. Crying Roman with a baby. Definitely cool. Come here,you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Urgh. Kissing and crying. I'll, I'll be back in a bit.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oi, you. Get in here, now. My daughter. What do you think?<|endoftext|>
|1| Hello. Hello, baby.<|endoftext|>
|0| Melody.<|endoftext|>
|1| Melody? Hello, Melody Pond.<|endoftext|>
|0| Melody Williams.<|endoftext|>
|0| Is a geography teacher. Melody Pond is a superhero.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well yes, I suppose she does smell nice. Never really sniffedher. Maybe I should give it a go. Amelia Pond, come here.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm sorry we were so long.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's okay. I knew you were coming. Both of you. My boys.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's okay. She's still all yours. And really, you should callher mummy, not big milk thing.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, what are you doing?<|endoftext|>
|1| I speak Baby.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, you don't.<|endoftext|>
|1| I speak everything, don't I, Melody Pond. No, it's not. it'scool.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor? Take a look. They're leaving. Demon's Run is ourswithout a drop of blood spilled. My friend, you have never risenhigher.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hey, what's wrong?<|endoftext|>
|0| She doesn't like the Tardis noise. I asked him to turn somethingoff, but it was all, but I don't want to punch a hole in the space-timecontinuum. Shush.<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory! The Judoon have escorted the Clerics out of the quadrant.Spitfires have returned to their own time. Captain Avery and his menare going. Is she all right?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, she's just crying.<|endoftext|>
|0| Give her to me, human fool. She needs changing.<|endoftext|>
|0| I just changed her. I think she might need a feed.<|endoftext|>
|0| A feed, of course. I'll take care of everything.<|endoftext|>
|0| Er, I really don't think you will, actually.<|endoftext|>
|0| I have gene-spliced myself for all nursing duties. I can producemagnificent quantities of lactic fluid.<|endoftext|>
|1| She's not hungry, she's tired. Sorry, Melody, they're just notlistening.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's this?<|endoftext|>
|1| Very pretty, according to your daughter.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's a, it's a cot.<|endoftext|>
|1| No flies on the Roman. Give her here.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hey, there we go.<|endoftext|>
|0| But where would you get a cot?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's old. Really old. Doctor, er, do you have children?<|endoftext|>
|1| No.<|endoftext|>
|0| Have you ever had children?<|endoftext|>
|1| No, it's real. It's my hair.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who slept in here?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, we need you in the main control room.<|endoftext|>
|1| Be right there! Things to do. I've still got to work out whatthis base is for. We can't leave till we know.<|endoftext|>
|0| But this is where I was? The whole time I thought I was on theTardis, I was really here?<|endoftext|>
|1| Er, Centurian, permission to hug?<|endoftext|>
|0| Be aware, I do have a sword.<|endoftext|>
|1| At all times. You were on the Tardis, too. Your heart, yourmind, your soul. But physically, yes, you were still in this place.<|endoftext|>
|0| And when I saw that face looking through the hatch, that womanlooking at me.<|endoftext|>
|1| Reality bleeding through. They must have taken you quite awhile back. Just before America.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's probably enough hugging now. So her Flesh avatar was withus all that time. But that means they were projecting a control signalright into the Tardis wherever we were in time and space.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, they're very clever.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who are?<|endoftext|>
|0| Whoever wants our baby.<|endoftext|>
|0| But why do they want her?<|endoftext|>
|1| Exactly.<|endoftext|>
|0| Is there anything you're not telling us? You knew Amy wasn'treal. You never said.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, I couldn't be sure they weren't listening.<|endoftext|>
|0| But you always hold out on us. Please, not this time. Doctor, it'sour baby. Tell us something. One little thing.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's mine.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is?<|endoftext|>
|1| The cot. It's my cot. I slept in there.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, my God. It's the Doctor's first stars.<|endoftext|>
|0| She's<|endoftext|>
|0| Drop your weapons. State your rank and intent. I found itlistening at the door.<|endoftext|>
|1| You've hacked into their software, then?<|endoftext|>
|0| I believe I sold it to them.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ooo. So what have we learned?<|endoftext|>
|0| That anger is always the shortest distance to a mistake.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm sorry?<|endoftext|>
|0| The words of an old friend who once found me in the LondonUnderground, attempting to avenge my sisters on perfectly innocenttunnel diggers.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, you were very cross at the time.<|endoftext|>
|0| As you were today, old friend. Point taken, I hope. Now, I havea question. A simple one. Is Melody human?<|endoftext|>
|1| Sorry, what? Of course she is. Completely human. What are youtalking about?<|endoftext|>
|0| They've been scanning her since she was born, and I think theyfound what they were looking for.<|endoftext|>
|1| Human DNA.<|endoftext|>
|0| Look closer. Human plus. Specifically, human plus Time Lord.<|endoftext|>
|0| I heard her talking. This is a trap. Whywould I lie to you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, you might want to take a look at your uniform.<|endoftext|>
|0| The only reason I joined the Clerics was so I could meet theDoctor again.<|endoftext|>
|0| You wanted to meet him, so you joined an army to fight him?<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, how else do you meet a great warrior?<|endoftext|>
|0| He's not a warrior.<|endoftext|>
|0| Then why is he called the Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's starting. Please, listen to me.<|endoftext|>
|1| But she's human. She's Amy and Rory'sdaughter.<|endoftext|>
|0| You've told me about your people. They became what they didthrough prolonged exposure to the time vortex. The Untempered Schism.<|endoftext|>
|1| Over billions of years. It didn't just happen.<|endoftext|>
|0| So how close is she? Could she even regenerate?<|endoftext|>
|1| No, no. I don't think so.<|endoftext|>
|0| You don't sound so sure.<|endoftext|>
|1| Because I don't understand how this happened.<|endoftext|>
|0| Which leads me to ask when did it happen?<|endoftext|>
|1| When?<|endoftext|>
|0| I am trying to be delicate. I know how you can blush. When didthis baby begin?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, you mean<|endoftext|>
|0| Quite.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, how would I know? That's all human-y, private stuff. Itjust sort of goes on. They don't put up a balloon, or anything.<|endoftext|>
|0| But could the child have begun on the Tardis in flight, in thevortex.<|endoftext|>
|1| No! No! Impossible! It's all running about, sexy fish vampiresand blowing up stuff. And Rory wasn't even there at the beginning. Thenhe was dead, then he didn't exist, then he was plastic. Then I had toreboot the whole universe. Long story. So, technically the first timethey were on the Tardis together in this version of reality, was ontheir w<|endoftext|>
|0| On their what?<|endoftext|>
|1| On their wedding night.<|endoftext|>
|0| Confirmed. No life forms registering on thisbase, except us and the Silurians.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Headless Monks aren't alive. They don't register as lifeforms.<|endoftext|>
|1| It doesn't make sense. You can't just cookyourself a Time Lord.<|endoftext|>
|0| Of course not. But you gave them one hell of a start, andthey've been working very hard ever since.<|endoftext|>
|0| And yet they gave in so easily. Does this not that botheranyone else?<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy. She worried the baby would have a time head. She said that<|endoftext|>
|0| Only you would ignore the instincts of a mother.<|endoftext|>
|0| Or the instincts of a coward. This is too easy. There'ssomething wrong.<|endoftext|>
|1| Why even do it? Even if you could get your hands on a brand newTime Lord, what for?<|endoftext|>
|0| A weapon?<|endoftext|>
|1| Why would a Time Lord be a weapon?<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, they've seen you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Me?<|endoftext|>
|0| Mister Maldovar, you're right. This was too easy. We should getback to the others.<|endoftext|>
|1| Me?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'd say she's human, going by the life-supportsoftware. She climbed out of the suit, like she forced her way out. Shemust be incredibly strong.<|endoftext|>
|0| I see you accessed our files. Do you understandyet? Oh, don't worry, I'm a long way away. But I like to keep tabs onyou. The child, then. What do you think?<|endoftext|>
|1| What is she?<|endoftext|>
|0| Hope. Hope in this endless, bitter war.<|endoftext|>
|1| What war? Against who?<|endoftext|>
|0| Against you, Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's that?<|endoftext|>
|0| A force field.<|endoftext|>
|0| And those are the doors locking.<|endoftext|>
|0| Apparently we're not leaving.<|endoftext|>
|0| Is that the Monks?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, dear God. That's the attack prayer.<|endoftext|>
|0| Quick, come with me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Commander Strax!<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm trying to seal off this area of the lighting grid.<|endoftext|>
|0| This is where we'll make our stand. Clear lines of sight on allapproaches.<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory, no offence to the others, but you let them all die first,okay?<|endoftext|>
|0| You're so Scottish.<|endoftext|>
|0| Centurian, you're needed!<|endoftext|>
|0| There should be some plasma pistols somewhere. They lefteverything.<|endoftext|>
|0| Then find them, boy!<|endoftext|>
|0| She's definitely a girl.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, stop it!<|endoftext|>
|0| We don't have to fight them. I'm friends to the Monks. Theyknow me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, and they know you just sold them out to the Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, they'll understand it's only me. Only silly old me. Youunderstand, don't you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Mister Maldovar, get back here!<|endoftext|>
|0| Arm yourself, fool!<|endoftext|>
|0| Dorium!<|endoftext|>
|0| Mister Maldovar?<|endoftext|>
|0| Dorium?<|endoftext|>
|0| The child. At all costs, protect the child!<|endoftext|>
|1| A child is not a weapon!<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, give us time. She can be. She will be.<|endoftext|>
|1| Except you've already lost her, and I swear I will never letyou anywhere near her again.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, Doctor. Fooling you once was a joy, butfooling you twice the same way? It's a privilege.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy. Amy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Demons run when a good man goes to war. Night will fall anddrown the sun, when a good man goes to war. Friendship dies and truelove lies, night will fall and the dark will rise, when a good man goesto war.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy!<|endoftext|>
|0| Demons run but count the cost. The battle's won, but thechild is lost.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy! <|endoftext|>
|0| Wakey, wakey.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy!<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory? Rory! Rory!<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy, she's not real! Melody, she's a Flesh avatar. Amy!<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy! Amy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, we know.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's strange. I have often dreamed of dying in combat. I'm notenjoying it as much as I'd hoped.<|endoftext|>
|0| Come on, Strax. Don't give up.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's all right. I've had a good life. I'm nearly twelve.<|endoftext|>
|0| Listen to me. You'll be back on your feet in no time. You're awarrior.<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory, I'm a nurse.<|endoftext|>
|0| So they took her anyway. All this was for nothing.<|endoftext|>
|1| I am so sorry.<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy, it's not his fault.<|endoftext|>
|0| I know. I know.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, there's someone who wants to speak to you. Her name isLorna. She came to warn us.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hey. Hello.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| You helped my friends. Thank you.<|endoftext|>
|0| I met you once, in the Gamma Forests. You don't remember me.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hey, of course I remember. I remember everyone. Hey, we ran,you and me. Didn't we run, Lorna?<|endoftext|>
|1| Who was she?<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't know, but she was very brave.<|endoftext|>
|1| They're always brave. They're always brave.<|endoftext|>
|0| So, what now? They'd almost certainly have taken her to Earth.Raise her in the correct environment.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, they did. And it's already too late.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're giving up? You never do that.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, and don't you sometimes wish I did?<|endoftext|>
|0| Well then, soldier. How goes the day?<|endoftext|>
|1| Where the hell have you been? Every time you've asked, I havebeen there. Where the hell were you today?<|endoftext|>
|0| I couldn't have prevented this.<|endoftext|>
|1| You could have tried!<|endoftext|>
|0| And so, my love, could you. I know you're not all right. Buthold tight, Amy, because you're going to be.<|endoftext|>
|1| You think I wanted this? I didn't do this. This, this wasn'tme!<|endoftext|>
|0| This was exactly you. All this. All of it. You make them soafraid. When you began, all those years ago, sailing off to see theuniverse, did you ever think you'd become this? The man who can turn anarmy around at the mention of his name. Doctor. The word for healer andwise man throughout the universe. We get that word from you, you know.But if you carry on the way you are, what might that word come to mean?To the people of the Gamma Forests, the word Doctor means mightywarrior. How far you've come. And now they've taken a child, the childof your best friends, and they're going to turn her into a weapon justto bring you down. And all this, my love, in fear of you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Who are you?<|endoftext|>

|0| You can't keep doing this. You're going to end up in prison.<|endoftext|>
|1| Sorry. Hello. Doctor not following this. Doctor very lost. Younever said I was hot?<|endoftext|>
|0| Is that the phone box? The bigger on the inside phone box? Oh,time travel. That's just brilliant. Yeah, I've heard a lot about you.I'm their best mate.<|endoftext|>
|1| Then why don't I know you? I danced with everyone at thewedding. The women were all brilliant. The men were a bit shy.<|endoftext|>

|0| And that's me out of time.<|endoftext|>
|0| Mels!<|endoftext|>

|0| Okay. Hi, Mels.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hi, Rory.<|endoftext|>

|0| Because the Doctor didn't save it. Except you don't knowabout the Doctor because you're stupid.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why are you always in trouble? You're the most in trouble inthe whole school, except for boys.<|endoftext|>
|0| And you.<|endoftext|>
|0| I count as a boy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Am I getting warm?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, Rory.<|endoftext|>
|0| Mels?<|endoftext|>
|0| A significant factor in Hitler's rise to power was the fact thatthe Doctor didn't stop him.<|endoftext|>
|0| I can't keep doing this.<|endoftext|>
|0| Mels!<|endoftext|>
|0| It was late. I took a bus.<|endoftext|>

|0| Why can't you just act like a person? Like a normal legal person?<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't know, maybe I need a Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Stop it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Er, I'd better go. I'm on earlies tomorrow.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's all right for you. You've got Mister Perfect keeping youright.<|endoftext|>

|0| Thank you, whoever you are. I think you have just saved mylife.<|endoftext|>
|1| Believe me, it was an accident.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is this thing?<|endoftext|>
|0| What did he mean, we saved his life? We could not have just savedHitler.<|endoftext|>
|1| You see? You see? Time travel, it never goes to plan.<|endoftext|>
|0| This box. What is it?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's a police telephone box from London, England. That's right,Adolf. The British are coming.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, stop him!<|endoftext|>
|0| Damage report! Damage report!<|endoftext|>
|0| Sit still, shut up.<|endoftext|>

|0| Sir, that blue box. I've got a match. We'retrying to bag war criminals, we've got the biggest one ever right underour noses. Forget Hitler. If we take this one down, the JusticeDepartment will give us the rest of the year off.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you sure?<|endoftext|>
|0| There's no question. It's her.<|endoftext|>
|0| How bad is it? Rory, what can we do?<|endoftext|>
|0| Just keep her conscious. Stay with us, Mels.<|endoftext|>

|0| Okay, Doctor, explain what is happening, please.<|endoftext|>
|1| Mels. Short for<|endoftext|>
|0| Melody.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah. I named my daughter after her.<|endoftext|>
|1| You named your daughter after your daughter.<|endoftext|>
|0| It took me years to find you two. I'm so glad I did. And you see?It all worked out in the end, didn't it. You got to raise me after all.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're Melody?<|endoftext|>
|0| But if she's Melody, that means that she's also<|endoftext|>
|0| Shut up, Dad. I'm focusing on a dress size.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh! Oh! Oh! Whoa! Right, let's see, then. Ooo, it's all going ondown there, isn't it? The hair! Oh, the hair. It just doesn't stop,does it? Look at that. Everything changes. Oh, but I love it. I loveit! I'm all sort of mature.<|endoftext|>

|0| Spoilers? What's spoilers? Hang on, just something I have tocheck.<|endoftext|>
|0| Is anybody else finding today just a bit difficult? I'm getting asort of banging in my head.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, I think that's Hitler in the cupboard.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's not helping.<|endoftext|>
|1| This isn't the River Song we know yet. This is her right at thestart. Doesn't even know her own name.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm going to wear lots of jodhpurs.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, that's her all right. Melody Pond,the woman who kills the Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, now, enough of all that. Down tobusiness.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, hello. I thought we were getting married.<|endoftext|>
|0| I told you I'm not a wedding person.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, what's she doing?<|endoftext|>
|1| What she's programmed to.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where'd she get the gun?<|endoftext|>
|1| Hello, Benjamin.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello, Benjamin!<|endoftext|>
|0| You noticed.<|endoftext|>
|1| Of course I noticed.<|endoftext|>
|1| As soon as I knew you were coming, I tidied up a bit.<|endoftext|>
|0| I know you did.<|endoftext|>
|0| Watch out that bow tie.<|endoftext|>
|1| I know you know.<|endoftext|>
|0| Goodness, is killing you going to take all day?<|endoftext|>
|1| Why? Are you busy?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, I'm not complaining.<|endoftext|>
|1| If you were in a hurry, you could've killed me in thecornfield.<|endoftext|>
|0| We'd only just met. I'm a psychopath. I'm not rude.<|endoftext|>
|0| You are not a psychopath. Why would she be a psychopath?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, Mummy, Mummy, pay attention. I was trained and conditionedfor one purpose. I was born to kill the Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| Demons Run, remember? This is what they were building. Mybespoke psychopath.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm all yours, sweetie.<|endoftext|>
|1| Only River Song gets to call me that.<|endoftext|>
|0| And who's River Song?<|endoftext|>
|1| An old friend of mine.<|endoftext|>
|0| Stupid name. Oh, look at that. Berlin on the eve of war. A wholeworld about to tear itself apart. Now that's my kind of town. Mum, Dad,don't follow me. And, yes, that is a warning.<|endoftext|>
|1| No warning for me then?<|endoftext|>
|0| No need, my love. The deed is done and so are you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, what's wrong?<|endoftext|>
|1| What have you done? River!<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, River, River, River. More than a friend, I think.<|endoftext|>
|1| What have you done?<|endoftext|>
|0| It was never going to be a gun for you, Doctor. The man of peacewho understands every kind of warfare, except, perhaps, the cruellest.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm all yours, sweetie.<|endoftext|>
|0| Kiss, kiss.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's wrong with you? What's she done to you?<|endoftext|>
|1| Poisoned me. But I'm fine. Well, no, I'm dying, but I've got aplan.<|endoftext|>
|0| What plan?<|endoftext|>
|1| Not dying. See? Fine.<|endoftext|>
|0| Scanning him. He's dying all right.<|endoftext|>
|0| But he can't be.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, what do we do? How do we help you?<|endoftext|>
|1| Take this. The Tardis can home in on it. Now, go. Get afterher.<|endoftext|>
|0| Halt!<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello, boys.<|endoftext|>
|0| You said the smoke was deadly.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, no, the smoke's fine. The poison will kill me first. Now,get after River!<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't understand, okay? One minute she's going to marry you andthen she's going to kill you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah, well, she's been brainwashed. It all makes sense to her.Plus, she is a woman. Oh, shut up. I'm dying.<|endoftext|>
|1| Extractor fans on! Oh, that works.<|endoftext|>
|0| What are you doing here?<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, I was on my way to this gay Gypsy Bar-Mitzvah for thedisabled, when I thought gosh, the Third Reich's a bit rubbish. I thinkI'll kill the Fuhrer. Who's with me?<|endoftext|>
|0| Shoot her.<|endoftext|>
|0| No!<|endoftext|>
|0| Tip for you all. Never shoot a girl while she's regenerating.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ah! Now, that hit the spot. Thanks, boys. Call me.<|endoftext|>
|0| What are you doing?<|endoftext|>
|0| New body, new town. I'm going shopping.<|endoftext|>
|0| Look, I know how this looks. Let me explain everything from thebeginning.<|endoftext|>
|0| Heil!<|endoftext|>
|0| Heil!<|endoftext|>
|0| Come on!<|endoftext|>
|0| Can you ride a motorbike?<|endoftext|>
|0| I expect so. It's that sort of day.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay. This time, let's do the bike, too.<|endoftext|>
|0| You see, he can't be dying.<|endoftext|>
|0| But the Doctor is confirmed deceased. We have his records.<|endoftext|>
|0| But he doesn't die here. He dies in Utah, by Lake Silencio, Aprilthe twenty second, 2011.<|endoftext|>
|0| Time can be rewritten. Remember Kennedy?<|endoftext|>
|0| This time can't. It's a confirmed fixed point. The Doctor mustalways die exactly then. He always has and he always will.<|endoftext|>
|0| Then someone's screwed up, because he's dying right now.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm shutting down. I need an interface. Voice interface. Comeon, emergency.<|endoftext|>
|0| Voice interface enabled.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh no, no, no, no, no. Give me someone I like.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, thanks. Give me guilt.<|endoftext|>
|1| Also guilt.<|endoftext|>
|1| More guilt. Argh. Come on, there must be someone left in theuniverse I haven't screwed up yet.<|endoftext|>
|0| Voice interface enabled.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh. Oh, Amelia Pond, before I got it all wrong. My sweet littleAmelia.<|endoftext|>
|0| I am not Amelia Pond. I am a voice interface.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hey, let's run away and have adventures. Come along, Pond.<|endoftext|>
|0| I am not Amelia Pond. I am a voice interface.<|endoftext|>
|1| You are so Scottish. How am I doing?<|endoftext|>
|0| Your system has been contaminated by the poison of theJudas tree. You will be dead in thirty two minutes.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay. So, basically better regenerate, that's what you'resaying.<|endoftext|>
|0| Regeneration disabled. You will be dead in thirty twominutes.<|endoftext|>
|1| Unless I'm cured, yeah?<|endoftext|>
|0| There is no cure. You will be dead in thirty two minutes.<|endoftext|>
|1| Why do you keep saying that?<|endoftext|>
|0| Because you will be dead in thirty two minutes.<|endoftext|>
|1| You see? There you go again. Basically skipping thirty onewhole minutes when I'm absolutely fine. Scottish, that's all I'msaying.<|endoftext|>
|0| You will be fine for thirty one minutes. You will be deadin thirty two minutes.<|endoftext|>
|1| Scotland's never conquered anywhere, you know. Not even aShetland. River needs me. She's only just beginning. I can't die now.<|endoftext|>
|0| You will not die now. You will die in thirty two minutes.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm going out in the first round. Ringing any bells? Argh!Okay, need something for the pain now. Come on, Amelia. It's me.Please.<|endoftext|>
|0| I am not Amelia Pond. I am a voice interface.<|endoftext|>

|0| I am not Amelia Pond. I am a voice interface.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amelia. Amelia, please.<|endoftext|>

|1| What did you say? Fish fingers and custard? Oh, Amelia Pond.Fish fingers and custard. Fish fingers and custard!<|endoftext|>
|0| Ladies and gentleman, I don't have a thing to wear. Take offyour clothes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, all of Berlin. How do we find her?<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't know. Look for clues.<|endoftext|>
|0| Clues? What kind of clues?<|endoftext|>
|0| Shut up.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay.<|endoftext|>
|0| Now, look at that. Now that's fun from everyangle.<|endoftext|>
|0| Now dear, I told you not to follow me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay. Okay, I am trapped inside a giant robotreplica of my wife. I'm really trying not to see this as a metaphor.<|endoftext|>

|0| I might take the age down a little, justgradually, to freak people out.<|endoftext|>
|0| You killed the Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh yes, I know, dear. I hope you're not going to keep on aboutit. Oh, regeneration. It's a whole new colouring to work with.<|endoftext|>
|0| You killed the Doctor on the orders of the movementknown as the Silence and Academy of the Question. You accept and knowthis to be true?<|endoftext|>
|0| Quite honestly, I don't really remember. It was all a bit ofjumble.<|endoftext|>
|0| No! No! Get off me!<|endoftext|>
|1| Sorry, did you say she killed the Doctor? The Doctor? Doctorwho?<|endoftext|>
|0| You said he was dying.<|endoftext|>
|0| He is.<|endoftext|>
|0| When you're done here, your memories will be wiped and you'll beable to<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|0| You're dying and you stopped to change?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, you should always waste time when you don't have any. Timeis not the boss of you. Rule four hundred and eight. Amelia Pond,judgment death machine. Why am I not surprised? Sonic cane.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you serious?<|endoftext|>
|0| Never knowingly. Neverknowingly be serious.<|endoftext|>
|1| Rule twenty seven. You might want to writethese down. Oh, it's a robot.<|endoftext|>
|0| With four hundred andtwenty three life signs inside. A robot<|endoftext|>
|1| Worked by tiny people. Love it. But how doyou all get in there, though.<|endoftext|>
|0| Bigger on the inside? No,basic miniaturisation sustained by a<|endoftext|>
|1| Compression field. Ooo. Watch what you eat,it'll get you every time.<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy, if you and Rory areokay, signal me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Thanking you.<|endoftext|>
|0| How'd you do that?<|endoftext|>
|1| Argh! I'm so sorry. Leg went to sleep. Justhad a quick left leg power nap. I forgot I had one scheduled. Actually,better sit down. I think I heard the right one yawning.<|endoftext|>
|1| Don't you touch her! Do not harm her in any way!<|endoftext|>
|0| Why would you care? She's the women whokills you.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm not dead.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're dying.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, at least I'm not a time travelling shape shifting robotoperated by miniaturised cross people, which, I have got to admit, Ididn't see coming. What do you want with her?<|endoftext|>
|0| She's Melody Pond.<|endoftext|>
|0| According to records, the woman who killsthe Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| And I'm the Doctor. So what's it to you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Throughout history, many criminals havegone unpunished in their lifetimes. Time travel has responsibilities.<|endoftext|>
|1| What? You got yourselves time travel, soyou decided to punish dead people?<|endoftext|>
|0| We don't kill them. We extract them nearthe end of their established timelines.<|endoftext|>
|0| And then what?<|endoftext|>
|0| Give them hell.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'd ask you who you think you are<|endoftext|>
|0| But I think the answer ispretty obvious. So, who do you think<|endoftext|>
|1| I am, huh? The woman who killed the Doctor.It sounds like you've got my biography in there. I'd love a peek.<|endoftext|>
|0| Our records office is sealed to the public.Foreknowledge is dangerous.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, well, I'll be dead in three minutes.<|endoftext|>
|0| There isn't muchforeknowledge left.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry, can't do that.<|endoftext|>
|0| That man is my best friend. That woman is my daughter. You givehim anything he wants.<|endoftext|>
|0| If she's family, she has privileges.<|endoftext|>
|0| Say access personal records, the Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Access personal records, the Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Records available.<|endoftext|>
|1| Question. I'm dying. Who wants me dead?<|endoftext|>
|0| The Silence.<|endoftext|>
|1| What is the Silence? Why is it called that? What does it mean?<|endoftext|>
|0| The Silence is not a species. It is a religious order,or movement. Their core belief is that silence will fall when thequestion is asked.<|endoftext|>
|1| What question?<|endoftext|>
|0| The first question. The oldest question in the universe,hidden in plain sight.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, but what is the question?<|endoftext|>
|0| Unknown.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh. Well, fat lot of use that is, you big ginge. Call yourselfa Records argh! Argh! Kidneys are always the first to quit. I've hadbetter, you know.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, he's finished.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, my God.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well then, let's do what we do. Give her hell.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy. Rory. Amy<|endoftext|>
|0| Can you hear me?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah?<|endoftext|>
|0| You can talk to him.<|endoftext|>
|0| What do we do?<|endoftext|>
|0| This is me. This is me actually talking.<|endoftext|>
|0| What do we do?<|endoftext|>
|1| Just stop them. She's your daughter. Just stop them.<|endoftext|>
|0| How? How?<|endoftext|>
|0| How?<|endoftext|>
|1| Just do it!<|endoftext|>
|0| Privileges activated, see?<|endoftext|>
|0| She's your daughter. Just stop them.<|endoftext|>
|0| What are you doing?<|endoftext|>
|0| Pointing and thinking. Get ready to run.<|endoftext|>
|0| You are unauthorised. Your death will now be implemented.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, Captain. Release her now, or I take down the wholeTeselecta.<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy.<|endoftext|>
|0| You can't.<|endoftext|>
|0| They can.<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory, go!<|endoftext|>
|0| All privileges withdrawn.<|endoftext|>
|0| What have you done?<|endoftext|>
|0| All life forms prepare for immediate decease. You willexperience a tingling sensation and then death.<|endoftext|>
|0| Shut it down.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm trying!<|endoftext|>
|0| Shut everything down!<|endoftext|>
|1| Please. Now we have to save your parents. Don't run. Now, Iknow you're scared, but never run when you're scared. Rule seven.Please.<|endoftext|>
|0| Remain calm while your life is extracted.<|endoftext|>

|0| Where?<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't know. Just run!<|endoftext|>
|0| Mothership! Mothership, get us out of here!Emergency beam up now! Everyone!<|endoftext|>
|0| Only two life forms remain. This will be rectified.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where'd everyone go?<|endoftext|>
|0| How can they just disappear?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, can you help us? Doctor? Doctor, help us!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, help us! Doctor, please!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor! Help!<|endoftext|>
|0| Look at you. You still care.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, help! Doctor, help us! Please help us.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's impressive, I'll give you that.<|endoftext|>
|1| River, please.<|endoftext|>
|0| Again? Who is this River? She's got to be a woman. Am I right?<|endoftext|>
|1| Help me. Save Amy and Rory. Help me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Tell me about her. Go on.<|endoftext|>
|1| Just help me.<|endoftext|>
|0| You are unauthorised. You are unauthorised. Your death willnow be implemented.<|endoftext|>
|0| I love you.<|endoftext|>
|0| I love you too.<|endoftext|>
|0| You are unauthorised. Your death will now be implemented.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor? Doctor, you did it. He did it!<|endoftext|>
|0| I seem to be able to fly her. She showed me how. She taught me.The Doctor says I'm the child of the Tardis. What does he mean?<|endoftext|>
|0| Where is he?<|endoftext|>
|0| You can't die now. I know you don't die now.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, Pond, you've got a schedule for everything.<|endoftext|>
|0| But it doesn't make any sense.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, what do we do? Come on. How do we help you?<|endoftext|>
|1| No. Sorry, Rory, you can't. Nobody can. Ponds, listen to me. Ineed to talk to your daughter.<|endoftext|>
|1| Find her. Find River Song and tell her something from me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Tell her what?<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, I'm sure she knows.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who's River Song?<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you still working? Because I'm still a relative. Access fileson River Song.<|endoftext|>
|0| Records available.<|endoftext|>
|0| Show me her. Show me River Song.<|endoftext|>
|0| What did he say? The Doctor gave you a message for River Song.What was it?<|endoftext|>
|0| What's happening? River, what are you doing?<|endoftext|>
|0| Just tell me. The Doctor, is he worth it?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes! Yes, he is!<|endoftext|>
|1| River. No. What are you doing?<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello, sweetie.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hey.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hey. Where am I?<|endoftext|>
|0| You're safe now. Apparently, you used all your remainingregenerations in one go. You shouldn't have done that.<|endoftext|>
|0| Mother, I had to try.<|endoftext|>
|0| I know.<|endoftext|>
|0| He said no-one could save him, but he must have known I could.<|endoftext|>
|1| Rule one. The Doctor lies.<|endoftext|>
|0| She just needs to rest. She'll be absolutely fine.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, she won't. She will be amazing.<|endoftext|>
|0| So that's it, se leave her there?<|endoftext|>
|1| Sisters of the Infinite Schism. Greatest hospital in theuniverse.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, but she's our daughter. Doctor, she's River and she's ourdaughter.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy, I know. But we have to let her make her own way now. Wehave too much foreknowledge. Dangerous thing, foreknowledge.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's that?<|endoftext|>
|1| Nothing.<|endoftext|>
|1| Just some data I downloaded from the Teselecta. Very boring.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, River was brainwashed to kill you, right?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, she did kill me, and then she used her remaining lives tobring me back. As first dates go, I'd say that was mixed signals.<|endoftext|>
|0| But that stuff that they put in her head, is that gone now? TheRiver that we know in the future, she is in prison for murder.<|endoftext|>
|0| Whose murder? Will we see her again?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, she'll come looking for us.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, but how? How do people even look for you?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, Pond. Haven't you figured that one out yet?<|endoftext|>
|0| So then, tell me. Why do you want to study archaeology?<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, to be perfectly honest, Professor, I'm looking for a goodman.<|endoftext|>
|0| Bed.<|endoftext|>
|0| But Mum<|endoftext|>
|0| George, I won't tell you again. Get into bed. I'm going to belate for work. It's just the lift, love. How many more times?<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't like it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, what do we do with the things we don't like? We<|endoftext|>
|0| Put them in the cupboard.<|endoftext|>
|0| The thing. You have to do the thing, Mum.<|endoftext|>
|0| Five times. It has to be five times.<|endoftext|>
|0| Please save me from the monsters. Please save me from themonsters. Please save me from the monsters.<|endoftext|>
|0| All right now? Come on, George. There's nothing to be scaredof. Night, night then, love.<|endoftext|>
|0| How is he?<|endoftext|>
|0| He's in bed at least.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm worried about him. Why's he terrified all the time?<|endoftext|>
|0| He needs help.<|endoftext|>
|0| He's got us.<|endoftext|>
|0| He needs a doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Please save me from the monsters. Please save me from themonsters. Please save me from the monsters.<|endoftext|>
|1| Please save me from the monsters. Haven't done this in a while.<|endoftext|>
|0| Haven't done what? What are you doing?<|endoftext|>
|1| Making a house call.<|endoftext|>
|0| No offence, Doctor<|endoftext|>
|1| Meaning the opposite.<|endoftext|>
|0| But we could get a bus somewhere like this.<|endoftext|>
|1| The exact opposite.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, I suppose it can't all be planets and history and stuff,Rory.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, it can. Course it can. Planets and history and stuff.That's what we do. But not today. No. Today, we're answering a cry forhelp from the scariest place in the universe. A child's bedroom.<|endoftext|>
|0| Please save me from the monsters? Who sent that?<|endoftext|>
|1| That's what we're here to find out.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sounds like something a kid would say.<|endoftext|>
|1| Exactly. A scared kid. A very scared kid. So scared thatsomehow its cry for help got through to us in the Tardis.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, but you've traced it here.<|endoftext|>
|1| Exactly. Ah. Going up.<|endoftext|>
|0| Now, did you know there that there are twice as many petsas people here in the UK? Now that's a lot of animals and we want toknow how clever they are. Now, if you were watching BBC1 on Saturdaynight, you will have seen Rolf Harris and Kate Humble<|endoftext|>
|0| Hi.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hello.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are your mummy and daddy in, or is it just you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay.<|endoftext|>
|0| Is it about the bins?<|endoftext|>
|1| Pardon?<|endoftext|>
|0| Community support. Just checking up on community-based things.<|endoftext|>
|0| Can I help you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Hi. Er, yeah. No, sorry. I was just wondering if you've had anybother around here?<|endoftext|>
|0| Is everything okay?<|endoftext|>
|0| The bins. I can't be expected to get down all themstairs. I need new knees.<|endoftext|>
|0| Bother? What do you mean?<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, I mean<|endoftext|>
|0| Are your neighbours nice? Do you get on well?<|endoftext|>
|0| He didn't send you, did he?<|endoftext|>
|0| Who?<|endoftext|>
|0| Jim Purcell. Course we get on well. I'm their landlord. Theylove me, don't they?<|endoftext|>
|0| You're the landlord?<|endoftext|>
|1| Not the bins, no, Miss?<|endoftext|>
|0| Mrs Rossiter.<|endoftext|>
|0| I thought you'd know that, being from community support.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah. Yes. Yes, of course. Sorry.<|endoftext|>
|0| I've already got a new hip. I'll be able to manage when Iget the knees. Up and down them stairs like Sherpa Tensing, then.<|endoftext|>
|1| Can I come in?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh.<|endoftext|>
|0| Course not. You could be anyone.<|endoftext|>
|1| I could be, but I'm not.<|endoftext|>
|0| Or maybe it's best if I come back another time.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm the Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| We've got to find that kid.<|endoftext|>
|0| Maybe we should let the monsters gobble him up.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hey. Any luck?<|endoftext|>
|1| Three old ladies, a traffic warden from Croatia and a man withten cats.<|endoftext|>
|0| What are we actually looking for?<|endoftext|>
|1| Ten cats. Scared kid, remember?<|endoftext|>
|0| I found scary kids. Does that count?<|endoftext|>
|1| Er, try the next floor down. Catch you later.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay.<|endoftext|>
|0| Maybe it was, you know, junk mail.<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|0| The message on the psychic paper. Maybe it was just nothing.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh. Right. That was quick.<|endoftext|>
|1| Was it?<|endoftext|>
|0| Claire said she'd phone someone. Social Services.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes. Yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's not easy, you know, admitting your kid's got a problem.<|endoftext|>
|1| You've got a problem. I've got a problem. I bet they'reconnected, I'm the Doctor. Call me Doctor. What can I call you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Alex.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hello, Alex.<|endoftext|>
|1| So, tell me about George.<|endoftext|>
|0| What a blooming mess. I'm the only one who gives amonkeys round here any more. Shocking. Talking to yourself now, Elsie.They say it's the first sign.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, Lord. Come out of there! Don't be so ruddy horrible,trying to scare an old lady to death. It's not right. Is that you,George? I'll tell your mum and dad. Come on, you little devil. Let'ssee your face.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ever since he was born he's been a funny kid.<|endoftext|>
|1| Funny's good. We like funny, don't we?<|endoftext|>
|0| He never cries. Bottles it all up, I suppose. Tell him off, hejust looks at you.<|endoftext|>
|1| How old is he?<|endoftext|>
|0| He was eight in January. I mean, he should be growing out ofstuff like this, shouldn't he?<|endoftext|>
|1| Maybe. It's got worse, though lately?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah. We talked about getting help. You know, maybe sending himsomewhere. He started getting these nervous tics. You know, funnylittle cough, blinking all the time. But now it's got completely out ofhand. I mean, he's scared to death of everything.<|endoftext|>
|1| Pantaphobia.<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|1| That's what it's called. Pantaphobia. Not a fear of pantsthough, if that's what you're thinking. It's a fear of everything.Including pants, I suppose, in that case. Sorry. Go on.<|endoftext|>
|0| He hates clowns.<|endoftext|>
|1| Understandable.<|endoftext|>
|0| Old toys. He thinks the old lady across the way is a witch. Hehates having a bath in case there's something under the water.The lift sounds like someone breathing. Look, I don't know. I'm not anexpert. Maybe you can get through to him.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'll do my best.<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy? Amy? Are you here?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah. Here. No, here. It's me.<|endoftext|>
|0| You okay?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, I think so.<|endoftext|>
|0| What happened to the lift? We were in a lift, weren't we?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, yeah. We. I remember getting in and then. What?<|endoftext|>
|0| We're dead, aren't we.<|endoftext|>
|0| Eh?<|endoftext|>
|0| The lift fell and we're dead.<|endoftext|>
|0| Shut up.<|endoftext|>
|0| We're dead. Again.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, shut up. Let's just find out where we are.<|endoftext|>
|0| You know, it's obvious what's happened.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah? Really? Because it's not obvious to me.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Tardis has gone funny again. Some time slippy thing. Youknow, The Doctor's back there in Eastenders-land and we're stuck herein the past. This is probably seventeen hundred and something.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yay. My favourite year.<|endoftext|>
|0| George? You okay? What's the matter? Oh. Never mind. Were youhaving a nightmare, son?<|endoftext|>
|0| Wasn't a nightmare. I wasn't asleep. Who are you?<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm the Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| A doctor? Have you come to take me away?<|endoftext|>
|1| No, George. I just want to talk to you.<|endoftext|>
|0| What about?<|endoftext|>
|1| About the monsters.<|endoftext|>
|0| A bit neglected, wherever it is.<|endoftext|>
|0| Let's find the front door, at least. Then we can work out wherewe are. When we are.<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory?<|endoftext|>
|0| Hmm?<|endoftext|>
|0| Look at this.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, it's a copper pan.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, it's not. It's wood. It's made of wood and just painted tolook like copper.<|endoftext|>
|0| That is stupid.<|endoftext|>
|0| Wait. Hang on.<|endoftext|>
|0| There's a switch.<|endoftext|>
|0| Wow. Well, not seventeen hundred and something, then.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's glass. It's a glass eye.<|endoftext|>
|0| Stop doing that.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's not me. Come on.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah. Hang on.<|endoftext|>
|0| Maybe it was things on the telly, you know?<|endoftext|>
|1| Right.<|endoftext|>
|0| Scary stuff, getting under his skin, frightening him.<|endoftext|>
|1| Mmm-hmm.<|endoftext|>
|0| We stopped letting him watch.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, you don't want to do that.<|endoftext|>
|0| Then Claire thought it might have been something he was reading.<|endoftext|>
|1| Great. Reading's great. You like stories, George? Yeah? Me,too. When I was your age, about, ooo, a thousand years ago, I loved agood bedtime story. The Three Little Sontarans. The Emperor Dalek's NewClothes. Snow White And The Seven Keys To Doomsday, eh? All theclassics.<|endoftext|>
|1| Rubbish. Must be broken. I hate those things. Better tidy itaway, though, eh? How about in here? No. Not in the cupboard. Why notin there, George?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's a thing. A thing we got him doing ages back. Anything thatfrightens him, we put it in the cupboard. Creepy toys, scary pictures,that sort of thing.<|endoftext|>
|1| And is that where the monsters go? Yeah. There's nothing to bescared of, George. It's just a cupboard.<|endoftext|>
|0| Front door.<|endoftext|>
|0| Let's try down here.<|endoftext|>
|0| Evening.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, hi.<|endoftext|>
|0| How's Claire?<|endoftext|>
|0| Good, thanks. At work. Look, er, this really isn't a goodtime. Maybe later I<|endoftext|>
|0| And the kiddie?<|endoftext|>
|0| Good. Yeah.<|endoftext|>
|0| You know how I hate to mention it, but it's that timeagain.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| And you know I like my money prompt.<|endoftext|>
|0| The thing is, I still haven't found anywhere since the shopshut, and Claire's wage only goes so far. I thought we could, you know,come to some sort of arrangement.<|endoftext|>
|0| Is that a torch?<|endoftext|>
|1| Screwdriver.<|endoftext|>
|0| No can do, son. If I went around<|endoftext|>
|1| A sonic one. And other stuff.<|endoftext|>
|0| Please may I see the other stuff?<|endoftext|>
|1| You may.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah, pretty cool, eh?<|endoftext|>
|0| Listen to him. Isn't he awful, eh? Don'tgrowl at the nice man, Bernard. He don't mean to upset daddy, do you?<|endoftext|>
|0| No.<|endoftext|>
|0| Look, son, I know what you're thinking. Here comes horriblePurcell after his rent. Dog on a chain. See? Wasn't expecting that, wasyou? I'm not as daft as I look. In fact, I'm not daft at all.<|endoftext|>
|1| That's better. No tears from George, that'swhat I've heard. Go on, give us a smile, there's a brave littlesoldier. Bit rusty at this. Anyway, let's open this cupboard, eh?There's nothing to be<|endoftext|>
|1| (sotto) Off the scale. Off the scale. Off the scale. How?<|endoftext|>
|0| All I want is my three hundred and fifty pound. Simple asthat. Night, night. Come on, son. Come on.<|endoftext|>
|0| Right. Sorry about that. So, have we got this thing open yet?<|endoftext|>
|1| No! No, no, no, no, no. You don't want to do that.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why?<|endoftext|>
|1| Because George's monsters are real.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, at last. Argh.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is it?<|endoftext|>
|0| No doorknob. Wooden pans, a massive glass eye, and now nodoorknob.<|endoftext|>
|0| And this clock.<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|0| Look, the hands, they're painted on.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're supposed to be a professional. I'll never get him to sleepnow. It's so irresponsible.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, Alex. Responsible. Very. Cupboard bad. Cupboard not bare.Stay away from cupboard. And there's something else. Something I'vemissed. Something staring me in the face.<|endoftext|>
|0| Look, I'd like you to leave, please. You're just making thingsworse. Will you stop making tea. I want you to leave.<|endoftext|>
|1| No.<|endoftext|>
|0| What? What do you mean no? Leave. Get out. Now, please. Look,maybe this was a bad idea. We should sort out George ourselves.<|endoftext|>
|1| You can't.<|endoftext|>
|0| No one's going to tell us how to run our lives. I don't care whoyou are or what wheels have been set in motion. We'll sort it.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm not just a professional. I'm the Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's that supposed to mean?<|endoftext|>
|1| It means I've come a long way to get here, Alex. A very longway. George sent a message. A distress call, if you like. Whatever'sinside that cupboard is so terrible, so powerful, that it amplified thefears of an ordinary little boy across all the barriers of time andspace.<|endoftext|>
|0| Eh?<|endoftext|>
|1| Through crimson stars and silent stars and tumbling nebulaslike oceans set on fire. Through empires of glass and civilizations ofpure thought, and a whole, terrible, wonderful universe ofimpossibilities. You see these eyes? They're old eyes. And one thing Ican tell you, Alex. Monsters are real.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're not from Social Services, are you?<|endoftext|>
|1| First things first. You got any Jammie Dodgers?<|endoftext|>
|0| Please, I don't like being on me own.If there's anyone here, please help me.<|endoftext|>
|0| You hear that?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah. Wait.<|endoftext|>
|0| They're getting closer.<|endoftext|>
|0| They?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, it's just a. It's a dummy. Oh, it's just a dummy.<|endoftext|>
|0| This is weird.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, says the time travelling nurse. Yeah, er, let's just leavethat for now. Come on.<|endoftext|>
|1| What is it with these photos? Anyway. Good.Nice tea. Nothing like a cuppa, but, decision. Should we open thecupboard?<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|1| Should we?<|endoftext|>
|0| Well<|endoftext|>
|1| Got to open the cupboard, haven't we. Course we have. Come on,Alex. Alex, come on. How else will we ever find out what's going onhere?<|endoftext|>
|0| All right, but you said<|endoftext|>
|1| Monsters. Yeah, well, that's what I do. Breakfast, dinner andtea. Fight the monsters. So this, this is just an average day at theoffice for me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, yeah. You're right.<|endoftext|>
|1| Or maybe we shouldn't open the cupboard.<|endoftext|>
|0| Eh?<|endoftext|>
|1| We have no idea what might be in there. How powerful, how evilthat thing might be.<|endoftext|>
|0| We don't?<|endoftext|>
|1| Come on, Alex. Alex, come on. Are you crazy? We can't open thecupboard.<|endoftext|>
|0| God, no, no, we mustn't.<|endoftext|>
|1| Right. That settles it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes. Settles what?<|endoftext|>
|1| Going to open the cupboard.<|endoftext|>
|0| What the? Hold on a minute. This is not, no.<|endoftext|>
|0| Help me, Bernard. Help.<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't understand it. It has to be the cupboard. The readingsfrom the sonic screwdriver, they were<|endoftext|>
|1| How old is George, Alex?<|endoftext|>
|0| What? How old?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes. How old is George?<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, I told you. Just turned eight.<|endoftext|>
|1| So you remember when he was born, then?<|endoftext|>
|0| Of course.<|endoftext|>
|1| Course you do. How could you not? You and Claire. ChristmasEve, 2002, right?<|endoftext|>
|0| What? Er yeah.<|endoftext|>
|1| Couple of weeks before George was born. Tell me about the dayhe arrived. Must have been wonderful.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, it was the best day of my (big pause) life.<|endoftext|>
|1| Sure?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|1| You don't sound sure.<|endoftext|>
|0| What are you trying to say? Look, I don't like this. I've toldyou before, I want you to go.<|endoftext|>
|1| What's the matter, Alex?<|endoftext|>
|0| I can't. Oh, don't. Oh, this is scary.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, Alex, this is scary. Claire with baby George. Newborn, yes?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|1| Less than a month after Christmas.<|endoftext|>
|0| So?<|endoftext|>
|1| So look. Look. Claire's not pregnant.<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|1| Not pregnant.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, of course not. Claire can't have kids!<|endoftext|>
|1| Say that again.<|endoftext|>
|0| We tried everything. She was desperate. As much IVF as we couldafford, but. Claire can't have kids. How? How can I have forgottenthat?<|endoftext|>
|1| Who are you, George?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's not possible. This isn't<|endoftext|>
|1| George?<|endoftext|>
|1| George! George, what's going on? Are you doing it?<|endoftext|>
|0| What's happening?<|endoftext|>
|0| Please save me from the monsters. Please save me from themonsters. Please save me from the monsters. Please save me from themonsters.<|endoftext|>
|1| George, no!<|endoftext|>
|0| Please save me from the monsters. Please save me from themonsters. Please save me from the monsters.<|endoftext|>
|0| Help me, Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|0| Please save me from the monsters.<|endoftext|>
|1| George, no!<|endoftext|>
|0| Please save me from the monsters. Please save me from themonsters. Please save me from the monsters.<|endoftext|>
|0| No!<|endoftext|>
|0| Why aren't there any lights? I miss lights.You don't really miss things till they're gone, do you? It's like whatmy nan used to say. You'll never miss the water till the well runs dry.<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory.<|endoftext|>
|0| Except light, I mean, not water. Lights are great, aren't they? Imean if this place was all lit up, we wouldn't even be worried at all.<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory. Panicking, a bit.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, yeah. Sorry.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah.<|endoftext|>
|0| Help me, please. Keep them away from me. Keep them away.<|endoftext|>
|0| I take it all back. Panic now.<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't run away. We want to play.<|endoftext|>
|1| George! George, don't do this. We want to help you, George.<|endoftext|>
|0| We went, we went into the cupboard. We went into the cupboard.How can it be bigger in here?<|endoftext|>
|1| More common than you'd think, actually. You're okay.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where are we?<|endoftext|>
|1| Obvious, isn't it?<|endoftext|>
|0| No.<|endoftext|>
|1| Dolls' house. We're inside the dolls' house.<|endoftext|>
|0| The dolls' house?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, in the cupboard, in your flat. The dolls' house.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, no, just slow down, would you?<|endoftext|>
|1| Look. Wooden chicken. Cups, saucers, plates, knives, forks,fruit, chickens. Wood. So, we're either inside the dolls' house or thisa refuge for dirty posh people who eat wooden food. Or termites. Gianttermites trying to get on the property ladder. No. That's possible. Isthat possible?<|endoftext|>
|0| Look, will you stop? What is he? What isGeorge? And how could I forget that Claire can't have kids? How?<|endoftext|>
|1| Perception filter. Some kind of hugely powerful perceptionfilter. Convinced you and Claire, everyone. Made you change yourmemories. Now, what could do that?<|endoftext|>
|0| Just a mirror.<|endoftext|>
|0| Lock it!<|endoftext|>
|0| There isn't a lock.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, no, no, no, no!<|endoftext|>
|0| Come on!<|endoftext|>
|1| So, Claire can't have kids and something responded to that.Responded to that need. What could do that?<|endoftext|>
|0| I thought you were the expert, fighting monsters all day long.You tell me.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oi! Listen, mush. Old eyes, remember? I've been around theblock a few times. More than a few. They've knocked down the blocksI've been round and re-built them as bigger blocks. Super blocks. AndI've been round them as well. I can't remember everything.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor<|endoftext|>
|1| It's like trying to remember the name of someone you met at aparty when you were two.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, the lift.<|endoftext|>
|1| And I can't just plump for Brian like I normally do.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, listen!<|endoftext|>
|1| Shush. What's that?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's the lift. It's the sound that the lift makes. George isscared stiff of it.<|endoftext|>
|0| We can't stay in here. We've got to get out!<|endoftext|>
|0| Er, how?<|endoftext|>
|0| Take control, Rory. Take control of the only thing we can. Lettingthem in.<|endoftext|>
|0| Letting them in?<|endoftext|>
|0| It'll surprise them. We open the door and we push past them. Kickthem, punch them, anything, okay?<|endoftext|>
|0| Time to play.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay.<|endoftext|>
|0| Go on!<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy, come on.<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory!<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy! Get off<|endoftext|>
|0| (singing) Tick tock goes the clock, and all the years theyfly. Tick tock and all too soon, you and I must die.<|endoftext|>
|0| Five times.<|endoftext|>
|1| What?<|endoftext|>
|0| The lights. It's happening five times. It's like one of George'shabits. We have to switch the lights on and off five times.<|endoftext|>
|1| Now you're getting it.<|endoftext|>
|0| What do you mean?<|endoftext|>
|1| What do you tell George to do, Alex, with everything thatscares him?<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, put it in the cupboard.<|endoftext|>
|1| Exactly. And George isn't just an ordinary little boy, we knowthat now, so anything scary he puts in here. Scary toys, like thedolls' house. Scary noises, like, like the lift. Even his littlerituals have become part of it. A psychic repository for all his fears,but what is he?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, my God.<|endoftext|>
|0| A gun? You've got a gun?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's not a gun. Wood! I've got to invent a setting for wood.It's embarrassing.<|endoftext|>
|1| Come on.<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't run away. We just want to play.<|endoftext|>
|1| Massive psychic field, perfect perceptionfilter, and that need. That need of Claire's to, to. Stupid Doctor. Ow.<|endoftext|>
|1| George is a Tenza. Of course he is.<|endoftext|>
|0| He's a what?<|endoftext|>
|1| A cuckoo. A cuckoo in the nest. A Tenza. He's a Tenza. Millionsof them hatch in space and then whoomph, off they drift, looking for anest. The Tenza young can sense exactly what their foster parents wantand then they assimilate perfectly.<|endoftext|>
|0| George is an alien?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yep.<|endoftext|>
|0| But he's he's our child.<|endoftext|>
|1| Of course he is. The child you always wanted. He sensed thatinstinctively and sought you out, but something scared him. Startedthis cycle of fear. It's all completely instinctive, subconscious.George isn't even aware that he's controlling it. So we have to makehim aware. George!<|endoftext|>
|0| George, you're the only one who canstop this<|endoftext|>
|1| But you have to believe. You have tobelieve. You have to know you're safe.<|endoftext|>
|0| I can't save you from the monsters.<|endoftext|>
|1| Only you can. George, listen to me.<|endoftext|>
|0| George, listen to me.<|endoftext|>
|1| Rory!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|1| Where's Amy?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, no. George! George, you have to face your fears!<|endoftext|>
|0| You have to face them now.<|endoftext|>
|1| You have to open the cupboard, or we'll allbe trapped here forever in a living death. George!<|endoftext|>
|0| George, listen to me. George! George,listen to me. George!<|endoftext|>
|1| Please! George, you have to end this. Endthis. End it. End it now!<|endoftext|>
|1| George. George, you did it. You did it. Hey, it's okay. It'sall okay now. Everything's going to be fine.<|endoftext|>
|1| No! No! No, no, no, no, no. George, you created this wholeworld. This whole thing. You can smash it. You can destroy it.<|endoftext|>
|1| Something's holding him back. Something's holding him back.Something.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who are you?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm the Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| A doctor? Have you come to take me away? Away. Away.Away.<|endoftext|>
|1| That's what did it. That's what the trigger was. He thought youwere rejecting him. He thought he wasn't wanted, that someone was goingto come and take him away.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, we, we talked about it.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, and he heard you, Alex. A Tenza's sole function is to fitin, to be wanted, and you were rejecting him.<|endoftext|>
|0| We just couldn't cope! We needed help!<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, but George didn't know that. He thought you were rejectinghim. He still thinks it.<|endoftext|>
|0| But how can we keep him? How can we? He's not<|endoftext|>
|1| Not what?<|endoftext|>
|0| He's not human.<|endoftext|>
|1| No.<|endoftext|>
|0| Dad!<|endoftext|>
|0| Whatever you are, whatever you do, you're my son, and I willnever, ever send you away. Oh, George. Oh, my little boy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Dad.<|endoftext|>
|0| My little boy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Dad.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh dear. Must be them tablets. Oh. Oh, dear.<|endoftext|>
|0| Was I?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah.<|endoftext|>
|0| Right, stay still. Still as a statue, or I'll come and getyou.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm coming, I'm coming.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hi.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hey, close eyes.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hello. You're Claire, I expect. Claire, (air kisses) how'd youfeel about kippers?<|endoftext|>
|0| Er who<|endoftext|>
|0| They sent someone about George. It's all sorted.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, we had a great time, didn't we?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah.<|endoftext|>
|1| See? He's fine.<|endoftext|>
|0| What, just like that?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes. Trust me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, wait.<|endoftext|>
|1| Sorry, yes. Bye.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, no, you can't just. I mean<|endoftext|>
|1| It's sorted. You sorted it. Good man, Alex. Proud of you.<|endoftext|>
|0| What, that's it?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, apart from making sure he eats his greens and getting himinto a good school, yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| But is he going to, I don't know, sprout another head or threeeyes or something?<|endoftext|>
|1| He's one of the Tenza, remember. He'll adapt perfectly now.Hey! Be whatever you want him to be. I might pop back around puberty,mind you. Always a funny time.<|endoftext|>
|0| Kippers are getting cold.<|endoftext|>
|1| Come on, you two. Things to do, people tosee, whole civilisations to save. You feeling okay?<|endoftext|>
|0| Er, I think so.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, it's good to be all back together again, in the flesh.Come on.<|endoftext|>
|1| Now, did someone mention something aboutplanets and history and stuff?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah.<|endoftext|>
|1| Where do you want to go?<|endoftext|>
|0| Er<|endoftext|>
|1| Mind's gone blank.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, I have just been turned into a wooden dolly.<|endoftext|>
|1| Excuses, excuses.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's tough, though. It's like being given three wishes. The wholeuniverse?<|endoftext|>
|1| Or universes. Ooo, three wishes, like Ali Baba. How about that?<|endoftext|>
|0| (singing) Tick tock goes the clock, even for the Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| Apalapucia.<|endoftext|>
|0| Say it again?<|endoftext|>

|1| Chia.<|endoftext|>
|0| Apalapucia.<|endoftext|>
|1| Apalapucia.<|endoftext|>
|0| Apalapucia. What a beautiful word.<|endoftext|>
|1| Beautiful word, beautiful world. Apalapucia, voted number twoplanet in the top ten greatest destinations for the discerningintergalactic traveller.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why couldn't we go to number one?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's hideous. Everyone goes to number one. Planet of the coffeeshops. Apalapucia. I give you sunsets, spires, soaring silvercolonnades. I give you<|endoftext|>
|0| Doors.<|endoftext|>
|1| Doors. Yes. I give you doors. But on theother side of those doors, I give you sunsets, spires, soaring silvercolonnades.<|endoftext|>
|0| Have you seen my phone?<|endoftext|>
|1| Your phone?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah.<|endoftext|>
|1| Your mobile telephone? I bring you to a paradise planet, twobillion light years from Earth, and you want to update Twitter.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sunsets, spires, soaring silver colonnades. It's a camera phone.<|endoftext|>
|1| On the counter, by the DVDs.<|endoftext|>
|0| Thank you.<|endoftext|>
|0| How do we get in?<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't know. Push a button.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay, so rain check on the soaring silver colonnades.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah. It's a magnifying glass.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hey? Hey, it's locked.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, push the button.<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory?<|endoftext|>
|0| Come on, Amy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Great.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where is she? Where on wherever we are is my wife?<|endoftext|>
|1| Rory, I think I've found her.<|endoftext|>
|0| What do you mean you've found her? Whoa. No, but, she's not,she's not here.<|endoftext|>
|0| I can see her, but she's not here.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where am I? In fact, where are you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Whoa.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hands. Hello, hands. Robot with hands, Rory.<|endoftext|>
|0| Welcome to the Twostreams facility. Will you be visiting long?<|endoftext|>
|0| Er, Doctor, something's happening.<|endoftext|>
|1| Er, Amy? Stay calm. Stay still. Ah, time's gone wobbly. I hateit when it does that.<|endoftext|>
|0| Will you be visiting long?<|endoftext|>
|0| Good question. Bit sinister. What's the answer to not get uskilled?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's okay, I've got you, you're fine.<|endoftext|>
|0| Will you be visiting long?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor? A little help, Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| And where have you been?<|endoftext|>
|0| What do I tell it?<|endoftext|>
|0| I've been here a week.<|endoftext|>
|0| A week?<|endoftext|>
|1| A week? I'm so sorry. Ah-ha. Same room,different times. Two different timestreams running parallel but atdifferent speeds. Amy, you're in a faster timestream.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, it's going again.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|0| Come on. Gotcha. There.Stabilised, settled, shush.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why has this got hands?<|endoftext|>
|1| Organic skin. Ultimate universal interface, grown and grafted,not born. I mean, it's actually seeing with its fingers, scanning theroom. But why not just give it eyes?<|endoftext|>
|0| Will you be visiting long?<|endoftext|>
|1| As long as it takes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy, what exactly did you do?<|endoftext|>
|0| I just, I came in<|endoftext|>
|0| And I pressed the door button.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh.<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy, there are two buttons. Thegreen anchor and the red waterfall.<|endoftext|>
|0| Which one did you push?<|endoftext|>
|0| I pushed the red waterfall.<|endoftext|>
|0| Great.<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy?<|endoftext|>
|0| I pressed Red Waterfall, and she wasn'tthere.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay, so you can't follow her directly. You know, it's neversimple. Did you hear that, Handbot? She pressed the wrong button,that's all. We're aliens, we didn't know.<|endoftext|>
|0| Statement rejected. Apalapucia is under planet-widequarantine. This is a kindness facility for those infected withChen Seven.<|endoftext|>
|1| What?<|endoftext|>
|0| Chen Seven, hmm?<|endoftext|>
|1| The one day plague.<|endoftext|>
|0| What, you get it for a day?<|endoftext|>
|1| No, you get it, and you die in a day.<|endoftext|>
|0| There are forty thousand residents in the Twostreams Facility.Please remain in the sterile areas. Visiting hours are now.<|endoftext|>
|1| Sterile area. I'm safe.<|endoftext|>
|0| What about me?<|endoftext|>
|1| Chen Seven only affects two-hearted raceslike Apalapucians.<|endoftext|>
|0| And Time Lords.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, like me. Walk into that facility, I'm dead ina day.<|endoftext|>
|1| Time moves faster on Amy's side of theglass.<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy, you said you'd been here aweek. What did you eat?<|endoftext|>
|0| Nothing. I wasn't hungry.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, because that Red Waterfalltime is compressed. That's the point. The Time Glass syncs up the<|endoftext|>
|1| Two timestreams for visits. You could be inhere for a day, and watch them live out their entire lives.<|endoftext|>
|0| And watch them grow old in front of your eyes?<|endoftext|>
|0| That's horrible.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, Rory, it's kind. You've got a choice.Sit by their<|endoftext|>
|0| Bedside for twenty four hoursand watch them die, or sit in here for twenty four hours and watch themlive. Which would you choose?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor? Doctor, no, don't leave me.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm here, Amy. I'm right here.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where are you? Am I looking at you?<|endoftext|>
|1| Turn left just a fraction. Bit more. Stop. That's it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Eye to eye?<|endoftext|>
|1| Eye to eye to eye.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy, I'm taking the Time Glass back to the Tardis. Like satnav,I'll use it to get a lock, then smash through using the Tardis to getyou out. Until then, you're on your own.<|endoftext|>
|0| Er, what are you doing?<|endoftext|>
|1| Locking it on to Amy. Small act of vandalism. No one'll mind.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah, that'll be the small act of vandalism alarm. Amy, I needyou to go into the facility just for a bit. Find somewhere safe andleave me a sign. Remember, you're immune to Chen Seven, but don't letthem give you anything. They don't know you're alien. Their kindnesswill kill you. Now go.<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory, I love you. Now save me. Go on.<|endoftext|>
|1| This is locked onto Amy permanently. Playthe signal into the console, the Tardis'll follow it. Now then, I knowyou're in here.<|endoftext|>
|1| Er, er, ha ha! How do I look?<|endoftext|>
|0| Ridiculous.<|endoftext|>

|0| Oh, you can see what I see.<|endoftext|>
|1| We're breaking into Twostreams. Now, I can't go in there. TheChen Seven'll kill me, no regeneration. You will be my eyes and ears.<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory-cam. Rescue Amy. Got it.<|endoftext|>
|1| That's the spirit. Now, smashing through a timewall could get abit hairy.<|endoftext|>

|0| Come on, please.<|endoftext|>
|0| No residents detected. No residents detected.<|endoftext|>
|0| They didn't see me. They didn't see me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Red Waterfall. We made it.<|endoftext|>
|1| Good old us.<|endoftext|>
|1| Focus on the positive.<|endoftext|>
|0| We locked onto Amy's timestream.<|endoftext|>
|1| Eyes front, soldier.<|endoftext|>
|0| Right, yes. Sorry.<|endoftext|>
|1| Apalapucians are the great culturalscavengers, Rory. This gallery's a scrapbook of their favourite places.<|endoftext|>
|0| Bit of Earth, bit of alien, bit of whatever the hell that is.<|endoftext|>
|0| Interface?<|endoftext|>
|0| I am here, Amy Pond.<|endoftext|>
|0| Shush, shush. Turn that light off. So I'm, what is this? How doesit work?<|endoftext|>
|0| This is the Gate. From here you may depart to any ofTwostreams' entertainment zones.<|endoftext|>
|0| Cinema. Aquarium. Garden.<|endoftext|>
|0| Garden? Why not?<|endoftext|>
|0| Garden.<|endoftext|>
|0| That is beautiful. I mean, freaky hedges.<|endoftext|>
|0| The perfect replica of a Shill Governor's Mansion onShallanna.<|endoftext|>
|0| You really could spend a lifetime in here. Not that I'm going to.Interface?<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy Pond?<|endoftext|>
|0| Listen, I need somewhere safe to hide and wait for my friends.Where in Twostreams is safe?<|endoftext|>
|0| Twostreams is a safe, nurturing environment.<|endoftext|>
|0| You know what I mean. Where can I go so the Handbots can't findme? Okay. Before, I was stood by a sort of vent, and there was lightand smoke, and the Handbots couldn't see me. Why not? Okay, I will putit another way. What were those vent thingies?<|endoftext|>
|0| The vents channel the exhaust fumes from the TemporalEngines that hold the multiple timestreams in place.<|endoftext|>
|0| And these Temporal Engines mess up the Handbots' sensors. So,where's the Temporal Engines?<|endoftext|>
|0| Temporal Engines held within.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay.<|endoftext|>
|0| Do not be alarmed. This is a kindness.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ha! Don't like that, do you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Temporal engines. Somewhere to hide.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where is everyone?<|endoftext|>
|1| Right, Rory, switch the Time Glass on and sonic it.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm sending a command signal to thescrewdriver. Amy's here somewhere, if I can just get a lock on her.<|endoftext|>
|1| I wonder what happens if we mix thefilters?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, there they are. Forty thousand time streams overlapping.Red Waterfall isn't one time stream, it's thousands.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are they happy?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, Rory.<|endoftext|>
|1| Trust you to think of that.<|endoftext|>
|0| I think they're happy to be alive.Better than the alternative.<|endoftext|>
|0| I come in peace. Peace, peace, peace, peace.<|endoftext|>
|0| I waited.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry, what?<|endoftext|>
|0| I waited for you. I waited for you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, what's going on?<|endoftext|>
|1| Er<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy.<|endoftext|>
|0| I think the timestream lock might be a bit wobbly.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, please. Please.<|endoftext|>
|0| Duck.<|endoftext|>
|0| Handbots carry a black box in case they go offline. I've changedthe cause of termination from hostile to accidental.<|endoftext|>
|0| Easy to re-programme. Used mysonic probe.<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why?<|endoftext|>
|0| Because I've survived this long by making the Handbots think Idon't exist.<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't touch the hands.<|endoftext|>
|0| There's anaesthetic transfer on the skin. Ifthey touch you, you go to sleep.<|endoftext|>
|0| But you're still here?<|endoftext|>
|0| You didn't save me.<|endoftext|>
|0| But, this is the saving. This is the us saving you. The Doctorjust got the timing a bit out.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry.<|endoftext|>
|0| I've been on my own here a long, long time. I've had decades tothink nice thoughts about him. Got a bit harder to stay charitable onceI entered decade four.<|endoftext|>
|0| Forty years? Alone?<|endoftext|>
|0| Thirty six years, thanks.<|endoftext|>
|0| No. Right. I mean, you look great. Really, really.<|endoftext|>
|0| Eyes front, soldier.<|endoftext|>
|0| Still can't win then.<|endoftext|>
|0| In fact, I think I can now definitely say I hate him. I hate TheDoctor. I hate him more than I've ever hated anyone<|endoftext|>
|0| In my life, and you can hear everyword of this through those ridiculous glasses, can't you, Raggedy Man?<|endoftext|>
|1| Er, yes. Putting the speaker phone on.<|endoftext|>
|0| You told me to wait, and I did. A lifetime.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy<|endoftext|>
|0| You've got nothing to say to me.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy, behind you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Feedback. Knocks them out.<|endoftext|>
|0| Learned that trick on my firstday.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, so we just take the Tardis back to theright time stream, yeah?<|endoftext|>
|0| We can stop any of this happening.<|endoftext|>
|0| We locked on to a timestream, Rory.This is it.<|endoftext|>
|0| This is so wrong.<|endoftext|>
|0| I got old, Rory. What did you think was going to happen?<|endoftext|>
|0| Hey, I don't care that you got old. I care that we didn't growold together. Amy, come on, please.<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't touch me. Don't do that.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's like you're not even her.<|endoftext|>
|0| Thirty six years, three months, four days of solitary confinement.This facility was built to give people the chance to live.<|endoftext|>
|0| I walked in here and I died. Doyou have anything to say? Anything, Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|1| Where did you get a sonic screwdriver?<|endoftext|>
|0| I made it. And it's a sonic probe.<|endoftext|>
|0| You made a sonic screwdriver?<|endoftext|>
|0| Probe.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh.<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't worry about him. Sit down, Rory.<|endoftext|>
|0| You named him after me?<|endoftext|>
|0| Needed a bit of company.<|endoftext|>
|0| So he's like your pet? Is it safe?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yep. I disarmed it.<|endoftext|>
|0| How? Oh, you disarmed it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, don't get sentimental, it's just a robot. You'd have done thesame.<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't know that I would have.<|endoftext|>
|0| And there he is. The voice of God. Survive, becauseno one's going to come for you. Number one lesson.<|endoftext|>
|0| You taught me that.<|endoftext|>
|0| Is that really all I taught you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't you lecture me, blue-boxman flying through time and space on whimsy. All I've got, all I've hadfor thirty six years, is cold, hard reality.<|endoftext|>
|0| So no, I don't have a sonic screwdriverbecause I'm not off on a romp. I call it what it is. A probe. And Icall my life what it is. Hell.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy Pond, I am going to put this right. Yousaid you learned from an<|endoftext|>
|0| Interface. Can I speak with it?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doesn't work in here. Two twenty three. The garden'll be clearnow. Stay or go?<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry, me? No, I'm coming with you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Then try not to get killed. Or do. Whatever.<|endoftext|>
|0| When I first came here, I had to trick theInterface into giving me the information, but I've reprogrammed it now.It'll tell me anything except how to escape.<|endoftext|>
|0| You hacked it? That's genius.<|endoftext|>
|1| Sorry to interrupt that beautiful moment, but temporal engines<|endoftext|>
|1| Like that have a regulator valve. Has to bekept at a distance from the main reactor or there'd be feedback.Interface, where's the regulator?<|endoftext|>
|0| The regulator valve is held within.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh. Very, very ah.<|endoftext|>
|0| Interface, I need to run through sometechnical specifications.<|endoftext|>
|1| Rory, give me to Amy a minute.<|endoftext|>
|0| Here you go.<|endoftext|>
|0| They look ridiculous.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's what I told him. Still, anything beats a fez, eh?<|endoftext|>
|0| What is it?<|endoftext|>
|0| I think that's the first time I've laughed in thirty six years.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'll just, er, leave you two geniuses alone. I'll be back in aminute.<|endoftext|>
|0| There's still time, Amy. There's still time to fixeverything.<|endoftext|>
|0| How can you have a door without a wall?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh. Holographic wallpaper? Oh, sorry. Argh.<|endoftext|>
|0| Do not be alarmed. This is a kindness.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh.<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory?<|endoftext|>
|0| Glasses.<|endoftext|>
|0| You stupid<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh. You saved me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't get used to it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Have you been crying? A little bit.<|endoftext|>
|0| Shut up, Rory.<|endoftext|>
|0| You have, haven't you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Woman with a sword. Don't push it.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay. So, here's the plan.<|endoftext|>
|0| Time is always a bit wibbly-wobbly,but in Twostreams it's extrawobbly.<|endoftext|>
|1| I've worked out how to hijack the TemporalEngines and use them to fold two points of Amy's timeline together.We're bringing her out of the then and into the now. Amy, I just needto borrow your brain a minute. It won't hurt, probably. Almost probablyand then<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy Pond, I'm going to save you.<|endoftext|>
|0| No.<|endoftext|>
|0| Time's up. Handbots coming.<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy, you've got to help us help you. Ineed you to think back<|endoftext|>
|1| Thirty six years ago. Amy? Amy!<|endoftext|>
|0| You told her to leave us a sign.<|endoftext|>
|0| And she did. And she waited.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh Amy, why won't you help yourself?<|endoftext|>
|0| He wants to rescue past me from thirty six years back, which meansI'll cease to exist. Everything I've seen and done dissolves. Time isrewritten.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's, that's good, isn't it? <|endoftext|>
|0| I will die. Another Amy will take my place. An Amy who never gottrapped at Twostreams, an Amy who grew old with you, and she, in thirtysix years, won't be me.<|endoftext|>
|0| But you'll die in here!<|endoftext|>
|0| Not if you take me with you.<|endoftext|>
|0| You came to rescue me, so rescueme.<|endoftext|>
|0| Leave her and take you?<|endoftext|>
|1| We could take this Amy with us, easy, butif we do, our Amy has to wait thirty six years to be rescued.<|endoftext|>
|0| So I have to choose. Which wife do I want?<|endoftext|>
|0| She is me. We're both me.<|endoftext|>
|0| You being here is wrong. For a single day, an hour, let alone alifetime. I swore to protect you. I promised.<|endoftext|>
|1| Rory<|endoftext|>
|0| This is your fault.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm so sorry, but, Rory<|endoftext|>
|0| No, this is your fault! You should look in ahistory book once in a while, see if there's an outbreak of<|endoftext|>
|0| Plague or not.<|endoftext|>
|1| That is not how I travel.<|endoftext|>
|0| Then I do not want to travel with you!<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory, is the Time Glass still on? If the link's stillactive, I think I can hear Amy. Our Amy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, Amy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Look me in the face and say you won't helpher.<|endoftext|>
|0| I will not help her.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, okay. Look me in the face and say it now.<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory? Rory is that you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory, where are you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Same place as you, and a bit ahead.<|endoftext|>
|0| I remember this.<|endoftext|>
|0| But who's she? There's no one else here but. Me?<|endoftext|>
|0| Why are we still here?<|endoftext|>
|0| Because they leave you. Because they getin their Tardis and they fly away.<|endoftext|>
|0| No. Rory wouldn't, not ever. Something musthave stopped him.<|endoftext|>
|0| You did. Or rather, the old version ofyou.<|endoftext|>
|0| The me version of you. Irefuse to help them. I won't let them save myself.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why?<|endoftext|>
|0| If you escape, then I was never trappedhere. The last thirty six years of my life rewrites, and I cease toexist. That's why old me refused to help then. That's why I'm refusingto help now. And that's why you'll refuse to help when it's your turn.And nothing you can say will change that.<|endoftext|>
|0| Three words. What about Rory?<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory?<|endoftext|>
|0| I called my robot Rory.<|endoftext|>
|0| You called your robot Rory?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, so you didn't call it the Doctor, orBiggles<|endoftext|>
|0| Our favourite cat?<|endoftext|>
|0| Do you, er, do you<|endoftext|>
|0| Remember that summer when hecame back to school with that ridiculous haircut?<|endoftext|>
|0| He said he'd been in a rock band.<|endoftext|>
|0| Liar. And, and then he had to learn toplay the guitar.<|endoftext|>
|0| So we wouldn't know he couldn't play it. Mmmhmm.<|endoftext|>
|0| All those boys chasing me, but it wasonly ever Rory. Why was that?<|endoftext|>
|0| You know when sometimes you meet someone sobeautiful<|endoftext|>
|0| And then you actually talk to them,and five minutes later they're as dull as a brick?<|endoftext|>
|0| Then there's other people, and you meet themand think, not bad, they're okay. And then you get to know them, andtheir face just sort of becomes them, like their personality's writtenall over it. And they just turn into something so beautiful.<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory's the most beautiful man I've ever met.<|endoftext|>
|0| Please? Do it for him.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're asking me to defy destiny,causality, the nexus of time itself, for a boy.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're Amy, he's Rory, and oh yes, I am.<|endoftext|>
|0| I am going to pull time apart for you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, Doctor, Twostreams isback on air. Right, okay, so this is big news.<|endoftext|>
|0| This is temporal earthquake time. I amnow officially changing my own future. Hold on to your spectacles. Inmy past, I saw my future self refuse to help you. I'm now changing thatfuture and<|endoftext|>
|0| Agreeing. Every law of timesays that shouldn't be possible.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, except sometimes knowing your own future's what enablesyou to change it. Especially if you're bloody minded, contradictory<|endoftext|>
|0| And completely unpredictable.<|endoftext|>
|0| So basically, if you're Amy, then?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, if anyone could defeat pre-destiny,<|endoftext|>
|1| It's your wife.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's not about what I'm doing, but whoI'm doing it for. I'm trusting you to watch my back, Rory.<|endoftext|>
|0| Always. You and me, always.<|endoftext|>
|0| Because here's the deal. You take me, too. In the Tardis. Metoo.<|endoftext|>
|0| But that means that there'll be two of you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Permanently. Forever.<|endoftext|>
|0| And that way we both get to live.<|endoftext|>
|0| Two Amys together. Can that work?<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't know.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's your marriage.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| Perhaps. Maybe, if I shunted the realitycompensators on the Tardis, re-calibrated the Doomsday bumpers andjettisoned the karaoke bar, yes. Maybe. Yes. It could do it. The Tardiscould sustain the paradox.<|endoftext|>
|0| Right. Amy and Amy.<|endoftext|>
|0| The wife and the wife. Right. Right.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay. Amy, Past Amy, stand by the door.Future Amy, you too.<|endoftext|>
|0| Future Amy, can I borrow your sonicscr<|endoftext|>
|1| Probe.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's a screwdriver.<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory, sonic it. Double our power. Amy Now, you're our linkto Amy Then.<|endoftext|>
|1| We need to get a signal through, and thatsignal<|endoftext|>
|0| Will be a thought.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy Now and Amy Then, share a thought.Something so<|endoftext|>
|1| Powerful that it can rip through time. Rory<|endoftext|>
|1| Sonic the plinth front. Inside you'll find<|endoftext|>
|0| Three levers and a jumble of wiring.<|endoftext|>
|1| That's the regulator valve. After were-route it, you have ten minutes to get back to the Tardis.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay.<|endoftext|>
|1| Pull out the red and green receptors.Re-route the blue into the red and<|endoftext|>
|0| The green into blue. Leave the redloose and on no account<|endoftext|>
|1| Touch anything yellow. Come on, Rory. It'shardly rocket science. It's just<|endoftext|>
|1| Quantum physics.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, right. Blue into red and then green<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Now, the levers.<|endoftext|>
|1| Throw them in order.<|endoftext|>
|0| And Amys, start thinking the mostimportant thought you have ever had.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hold it in your head and do not let it go.Lever one.<|endoftext|>
|0| Macarena. Macarena.<|endoftext|>
|0| She's doing the Macarena.<|endoftext|>
|0| Macarena. Macarena.<|endoftext|>
|0| Our first kiss.<|endoftext|>
|1| Lever two, Rory. Lever three.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, Amy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, my God.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, my God.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't know what to<|endoftext|>
|0| Weird.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, this is weird. Right, just stop doing that.<|endoftext|>
|0| How about Amy One speaks first?<|endoftext|>
|0| Which one's Amy One?<|endoftext|>
|0| Well<|endoftext|>
|0| I am. No, I am. Rory? Rory, just stop doing that.<|endoftext|>
|1| Rory. Rory, take the glasses off. You'regetting temporal feedback.<|endoftext|>
|1| Whoa! Calm down, dear. Rory, Amy, we've created a massiveparadox and the Tardis hates it. She's self-phasing, trying to get outof here. What's the nasty Amy done to you. Just calm down, dear. Hangon in there. Rory, you've got eight minutes left. I'm sorry, you're onyour own now.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm not on my own. I've got my wives.<|endoftext|>
|0| Do not be alarmed.<|endoftext|>
|0| Incoming!<|endoftext|>
|0| Rhis is a kindness.<|endoftext|>
|0| With me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Do not be alarmed, this is a kindness. This is a kindness.<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy, Kate Hayler, year ten hockey.<|endoftext|>
|0| Go for the shins.<|endoftext|>
|0| This is a kindness.<|endoftext|>
|0| They're cutting off the Departure Gate. We can't get back to theTardis.<|endoftext|>
|0| Side door. We'll go behind them.<|endoftext|>
|0| So you think you're going to come with us,just like that.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, just like that.<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory, talk to her.<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory, talk to her.<|endoftext|>
|0| Now, ladies<|endoftext|>
|0| Where are you going to live?<|endoftext|>
|0| Not with you, don't worry. I'll go travelling. Pop back forChristmas, maybe Easter.<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy, you always say, cooking Christmas dinner, you wish there wastwo of you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Can't we just teleport in?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's not a teleport, it's a time jump.<|endoftext|>
|0| They can't shunt within the same timestream.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Tardis is in the Gallery.<|endoftext|>
|0| Gallery closed.<|endoftext|>
|0| The controls are stuck. They've locked them from outside.<|endoftext|>
|0| Can you unlock them?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, give me a minute and your cutest smile. That's theone.<|endoftext|>
|0| Can you stop flirting with me. You're old enough to be my<|endoftext|>
|0| I've known you my whole life. How many games of Doctors AndNurses? Shush. Don't get coy now.<|endoftext|>
|0| Er<|endoftext|>
|0| Do not be alarmed. This is a kindness. Do not be alarmed. Thisis a kindness. Do not be alarmed. This is a kindness.<|endoftext|>
|0| No!<|endoftext|>
|0| Come on.<|endoftext|>
|0| Go! I've got your back.<|endoftext|>
|0| Do not be alarmed. This is a kindness.<|endoftext|>
|0| No!<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah, it's just an anaesthetic. She'll befine.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm sorry.<|endoftext|>
|0| What are you doing?<|endoftext|>
|1| I lied to her, Rory. There can never be two Amys in the Tardis.The paradox is too massive.<|endoftext|>
|0| You can't leave her. She'll die.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, let me in.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, she'll never have existed. When we saveour Amy, this future won't have happened.<|endoftext|>
|0| But she happened. She's there.<|endoftext|>
|0| I trusted you!<|endoftext|>
|1| No, she's not real.<|endoftext|>
|0| She is real. Let her in.<|endoftext|>
|1| Look, we take this Amy, we leave ours. Only one Amy in theTardis. Which one do you want?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's your choice.<|endoftext|>
|0| This isn't fair. You're turning me into you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Your choice, Rory.<|endoftext|>
|0| I, er<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor? Doctor! Doctor? Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory, please.<|endoftext|>
|0| The look on your face when you carried her. Me. Her.<|endoftext|>
|0| When you carried her away. You usedto look at me like that.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'd forgotten how much you loved me. I'dforgotten how much I loved being her. Amy Pond, in the Tardis, withRory Williams.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm sorry, I can't do this.<|endoftext|>
|0| If you love me, don't let me in. Openthat door, I will, I'll come in. I don't want to die. I won't bow outbravely.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'll be kicking and screaming,fighting.<|endoftext|>
|0| To the end.<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy. Amy, I love you.<|endoftext|>
|0| I love you, too. Don't let me in. Tell Amy, your Amy, I'mgiving her the days. The days with you. The days to come.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm so, so sorry.<|endoftext|>
|0| The days I can't have. Take them, please.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm giving you my days.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm so, so sorry.<|endoftext|>
|0| Do not be alarmed. This is a kindness.<|endoftext|>
|0| Do not be alarmed. This is akindness.<|endoftext|>
|0| Interface?<|endoftext|>
|0| I am here, Amy Pond.<|endoftext|>
|0| Show me Earth. Show me home. Did I ever tell you about thisboy I met there, who pretended to be in a band?<|endoftext|>
|0| Did you always know it would never work?Saving both Amys?<|endoftext|>
|1| I promised you I'd save her, and there she is. Safe.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, there she is.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'll leave you two alone.<|endoftext|>
|0| You all right?<|endoftext|>
|0| Mmm hmm.<|endoftext|>
|0| How are you feeling?<|endoftext|>
|0| Where is she? <|endoftext|>
|0| My name is Lucy Hayward, and I'm the last one left.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's funny. You don't know what's going to be in your roomuntil you see it, then you realise it could have never been anythingelse.<|endoftext|>
|0| The gaps between my worship are getting shorter. This iswhat happened to the others. It's all so clear now. I'm so happy.Praise him. Praise him.<|endoftext|>
|0| Praise him.<|endoftext|>
|0| Praise him.<|endoftext|>
|0| Let's go to Ravan-Skala, he says. The people are six hundred feettall. You have to talk to them in hot air balloons and the TouristInformation Centre is made of one of their hats, he says. I'm sorry,but I don't see any huge hats.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy, Beaky, this could be the most exciting thing I have everseen.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're kidding.<|endoftext|>
|0| How can you be excited about a rubbish hotel on a rubbish bit ofEarth?<|endoftext|>
|1| Because, assembled Ponds, this is notEarth. This has just been made to look like Earth. The craftsmanshipinvolved. Can you imagine?<|endoftext|>
|0| What? Then where are we?<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't know. Something must have yanked us off course. Look atthe detail on that cheese plant!<|endoftext|>
|0| Right, but who would mock up an Earth hotel?<|endoftext|>
|1| Colonists maybe, recreating a bit of home, like when ex-patsopen English pubs in Majorca. No, whoever did this, I am shaking hisstroke her hand stroke tentacle.<|endoftext|>
|0| Have you seen these? Look at the labels underneath.<|endoftext|>
|0| Commander Halke, defeat.<|endoftext|>
|0| Tim Heath, having his photo taken. Lady Silver-Tear, Daleks.<|endoftext|>
|0| Paige Barnes, other people's socks. Tim Nelson, balloons. NovicePrin, sabrewolves. Royston Luke Gold, Plymouth? Lucy Hayward, thatbrutal gorilla. Doctor, what does it mean?<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't know. Let's find out.<|endoftext|>
|0| Whoa!<|endoftext|>
|1| Blimey, that was a bit quick.<|endoftext|>
|0| We surrender.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, it's okay, we're not<|endoftext|>
|0| We surrender.<|endoftext|>
|0| We're nice.<|endoftext|>
|1| She's threatening me with a chair leg.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who are you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh god, we're back in reception.<|endoftext|>
|0| We surrender.<|endoftext|>
|1| I've never been threatened with a chair leg before. No, hangon, I tell a lie.<|endoftext|>
|0| Did you just say, it's okay, we're nice?<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, I need everyone to shut up, now.<|endoftext|>
|0| Rita, be careful, yeah?<|endoftext|>
|0| Their pupils are dilated. They're as surprised as we are. Besideswhich, if it's a trick, it'll tell us something.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, you're good. Oh, she's good. Amy, with regret, you'refired.<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm kidding. (silent) We'll talk. (normal) I take it from thepathological compulsion to surrender, you're from Tivoli.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes. The most invaded planet in the galaxy. Our anthem iscalled Glory To Insert Name Here.<|endoftext|>
|1| You with the face, Howie, you said you were surprised to beback in reception.<|endoftext|>
|0| The walls move. Everything changes.<|endoftext|>
|1| You, clever one. What's he talking about?<|endoftext|>
|0| The corridors twist and stretch. Rooms vanish and pop upsomewhere else. It's like the hotel's alive.<|endoftext|>
|1| That's quite enough of that.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, and it's huge, with, like, no way out.<|endoftext|>
|0| Have you tried the front door?<|endoftext|>
|0| No. In two days it never occurred to us to try the front door.Thank God you're here.<|endoftext|>
|1| They're not doors, they're walls. Walls that look like doors.Door-walls, if you like, or dwalls. Woors even, though you'd probablygot it when you said they're not doors. I mean, the windows are<|endoftext|>
|1| Right, big day if you're a fan of walls.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's not just that. The rooms have things in them.<|endoftext|>
|1| Things? Hello! What kind of things? Interesting things? I lovethings, ask anyone.<|endoftext|>
|0| Bad dreams.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, that killed the mood. How did you get here?<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't know. I'd just started my shift. I must have passed out,because suddenly I was here.<|endoftext|>
|0| I was blogging. Next thing, this.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, I was at work. I'm in Town Planning. We're lining all thehighways with trees so invading forces can march in the shade.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah.<|endoftext|>
|0| Which is nice for them.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah.<|endoftext|>
|1| So, what have we got. People snatched from their lives anddropped into an endless, shifting maze that looks like a 1980s hotelwith bad dreams in the bedrooms.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, apart from anything else, that's just rude.<|endoftext|>
|1| We'll pop back to the Tardis, I'll do aplanet-wide diagnostic sweep, and then we'll have a sing song.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where's the Tardis? You parked it there, didn't you?<|endoftext|>
|0| What's a Tardis?<|endoftext|>
|0| Our way out. And it's gone.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay, this is bad. At the moment, I don't know how bad, butcertainly we're three buses, a long walk and eight quid in a taxi fromgood. Are there any more of you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Joe. But he's tied up right now.<|endoftext|>
|1| Doing what?<|endoftext|>
|0| No, I mean he's tied up right now.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hello. I'm the Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| We're going to die here.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, they certainly didn't mention that in the brochure. IsJoe there? Can I have a quick word?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, it's still me, Doctor, but I've seen the light. I lived ablasphemous life, but he has forgiven my inconstancy, and soon he shallfeast.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, you've been here two days. What's he waiting for?<|endoftext|>
|0| We weren't ready. We were still raw.<|endoftext|>
|1| But now you're what, cooked?<|endoftext|>
|0| If you like. Soon you will be, too. Be patient. First, find yourroom.<|endoftext|>
|1| My room.<|endoftext|>
|0| There's a room here for everyone, Doctor. Even you.<|endoftext|>
|1| You said you'd seen the light now.<|endoftext|>
|0| Nothing else matters anymore. Only him. It's like these things. Iused to hate them. They make me laugh now. Gottle o' geer. Gottle o'geer.<|endoftext|>
|0| You should go. He'll be here soon.<|endoftext|>
|1| I think you should come with me.<|endoftext|>
|1| Why you four? That's what I don'tunderstand. Aside from all the other things I don't understand.<|endoftext|>
|0| What does it matter? Sooner or later, someone will come alongand rescue us.<|endoftext|>
|0| Or enslave us.<|endoftext|>
|1| First, we find the Tardis. Quick thing before we go. If youfeel drawn to a particular room, do not go in, and make sure someoneelse can see you at all times.<|endoftext|>
|0| Joe said, he will feast. Is there something here with us?<|endoftext|>
|1| Something to add, Joe?<|endoftext|>
|0| Here comes a candle to light you to bed. Here comes a chopper tochop off your head. Chop, chop, chop, chop.<|endoftext|>
|0| Can we do something about him?<|endoftext|>
|0| Personally, I think you've got the right idea. Times like this,I think of my old school motto. Resistance Is Exhausting.<|endoftext|>
|0| I've worked out where we are.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hmm?<|endoftext|>
|0| Norway.<|endoftext|>
|0| Norway?<|endoftext|>
|0| You see, the US government has entire cities hidden in theNorwegian mountains. You see, Earth is on a collision course with thisother planet, and this is where they're going to send all the richpeople when it kicks off.<|endoftext|>
|0| Amazing.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's all there on the internet.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, it's amazing you've come up with a theory even more insanethan what's actually happening.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hello.<|endoftext|>
|0| Have you forgotten your PE kit again? Right, that's it, you'redoing it in your pants!<|endoftext|>
|1| Hey! Don't!<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, look, girls, it's H-H-H-Howie!<|endoftext|>
|0| What's loser in K-K-K-Klingon?<|endoftext|>
|0| Praise him.<|endoftext|>
|0| Shut the d, d, d, the door. This is just some m, m, messed upCIA stuff, I'm, I'm, I'm telling you.<|endoftext|>
|1| You're right. Keep telling yourself that. It's a CIA thing,nothing more.<|endoftext|>
|0| Er guys?<|endoftext|>
|0| Look.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, whatever that is, it's not real, yeah?<|endoftext|>
|1| No. No, I'm sure it isn't, but just in case, let's run away andhide anyway. In here.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, this way! I've found a<|endoftext|>
|0| A B in mathematics? You are lazy. Do youunderstand me, girl? Lazy.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm sorry. Daddy, I'm so sorry.<|endoftext|>
|0| Praise him.<|endoftext|>
|1| Rory, come on!<|endoftext|>
|0| There was a<|endoftext|>
|1| Come on!<|endoftext|>
|1| Eek!<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't blink.<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy, get back. Why haven't they got us yet?<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy, they're not real.<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|1| They should have got us by now. Amy, look at me. Focus on me.It's your bad dream, that's all.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't even think they're for us.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, what are you doing?<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm sorry, I just have to see what it is. I just have to see.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, look at you. Oh, you are beautiful. Oh, dear.<|endoftext|>
|1| I think it's going after Joe.<|endoftext|>
|0| Come on, come to me. Come to me. Argh!<|endoftext|>
|0| Praise him.<|endoftext|>
|1| Leave him alone!<|endoftext|>
|1| Joe!<|endoftext|>
|1| Joe! Joe!<|endoftext|>
|0| If we can wedge a chair under the door handles, that should stopanything from getting in.<|endoftext|>
|0| Help yourself to tea. Guys, tea over here.<|endoftext|>
|0| If it's any consolation, I've met the Weeping Angels, so I knowhow. In fact, I thought that room was for me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Joe was right. Whatever it is in here, it actually wants tokill us. Not oppress us or enslave us, kill us!<|endoftext|>
|0| Listen. The Doctor's been part of my life for so long now, andhe's never let me down. Even when I thought he had, when I was a kidand he left me, he came back. He saved me. And now he's going to saveyou. But don't tell him I said that, because the smugness would beterrifying.<|endoftext|>
|0| Of course, if the Weeping Angels were meant for me, then yourroom is still out there somewhere.<|endoftext|>
|0| Tea?<|endoftext|>
|0| Every time the Doctor gets pally with someone, I have thisoverwhelming urge to notify their next of kin. (laughs then flinches)Ooo. Sorry. The last time I said something like that, you hit me withyour shoe. And you literally had to sit down and unlace it first.<|endoftext|>
|0| What exactly happened to him?<|endoftext|>
|1| He died.<|endoftext|>
|0| You are a medical doctor, aren't you? You haven't just got adegree in cheese-making or something.<|endoftext|>
|1| No! Well, yes, both, actually. I mean, there is no cause. Allhis vital organs simply stopped, as if the simple spark of life, hisloves and hates, his faiths and fears were just taken, and this is acup of tea.<|endoftext|>
|0| Of course, I'm British, it's how we cope with trauma. That andtutting.<|endoftext|>
|1| But how did you make it?<|endoftext|>
|0| All hotels should have a well stocked kitchen, even alien fakeones. I heard you talking when you arrived. Look, it's no moreridiculous than Howie's CIA theory, or mine.<|endoftext|>
|1| Which is?<|endoftext|>
|0| This is Jahannam.<|endoftext|>
|1| You're a Muslim.<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't be frightened.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ha! You think this is Hell.<|endoftext|>
|0| The whole '80s hotel thing took me by surprise, though.<|endoftext|>
|1| And all these fears and phobias wandering about, most arecompletely unconnected to us, so why are they still here?<|endoftext|>
|0| Maybe the cleaners have gone on strike.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ha! I like you. You're a right clever clogs. But this isn'tHell, Rita.<|endoftext|>
|0| You don't understand. I say that without fear. Jahannam will playits tricks, and there'll be times when I want to run and scream, butI've tried to live a good life, and that knowledge keeps me sane,despite the monsters and the bonkers rooms. Gibbis is an alien, isn'the?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah. Sorry.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay. I'm going to file that under Freak Out About Later.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, look at this. I found it in a corridor, I completelyforgot I had it.<|endoftext|>
|1| (reads) Er, my name is Lucy Hayward and I'm the last one left.It took Luke first. It got him on his first day, almost as soon as wearrived.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's funny. You don't know what's going to be inyour room until you see it, then you realise it could never have been<|endoftext|>
|1| Anything else. I just saw mine. It was a gorilla from a bookI'd read as a kid. My God, that thing used to terrify me. The gapsbetween my worships are getting shorter, like contractions.<|endoftext|>
|0| This is what happened to the others, and how lucky theywere. It's all so clear now. I'm so happy. Praise him.<|endoftext|>
|1| Praise him.<|endoftext|>
|0| Praise him.<|endoftext|>
|1| What did you just say?<|endoftext|>
|0| Nothing. Praise him!<|endoftext|>
|0| This is what happened to Joe!<|endoftext|>
|0| God, it's going to come for me now.<|endoftext|>
|0| You'll lead it right here.<|endoftext|>
|1| I won't leave you. I promise you. You have my word on that.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't want to get eaten.<|endoftext|>
|0| Calm down.<|endoftext|>
|0| He's going to lead the creature right here!<|endoftext|>
|1| Hold it!<|endoftext|>
|1| Thank you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't you see? He'll lead it right here.<|endoftext|>
|0| What do you suggest?<|endoftext|>
|0| Look, whatever it is out there, it's obviously chosen Howard asits next course. Now, tragic though that is, this is no time forsentiment. I'm saying if it were to find him, it may be satisfied andlet the rest of us go. All I want to do is go home and be conquered andoppressed. Is that too much to ask?!<|endoftext|>
|0| It's okay. I'll stay with Howie. You take the others and go.<|endoftext|>
|1| No. We stay together.<|endoftext|>
|1| Your civilisation is one of the oldest in the galaxy. Now I seewhy. Your cowardice isn't quaint, it's sly, aggressive. It's how thatgene of gutlessness has survived while so many others have perished.Well, not today. No one else dies today. Right? Brilliant. Howie, anysecond, it's going to possess you again. When it does, I'm going to askyou some questions. Please try to answer them.<|endoftext|>
|0| I hope my mum's all right, she's going to be w, worried.<|endoftext|>
|1| Howie? Howie. Howie, you're next. We're all dead jealous. So,tell us. How do we get a piece of the action? Why isn't he possessingall of us?<|endoftext|>
|0| You guys have got all these distractions, all these obstacles.It'd be so much easier if you just let it go, you know? Clear the path.<|endoftext|>
|0| You want it to find you even though you know what it's going todo?<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you kidding? He's going to kill us all. How cool is that?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's as I thought. It feeds on fear. Everything, the rooms,Lucy's note, even the pictures in reception, has been put here tofrighten us. So we have to resist it. Do whatever you have to. Crossyour fingers, say a prayer, think of a basket of kittens, but do notgive in to the fear.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, but what are we actually going to do?<|endoftext|>
|1| We're going to catch ourselves a monster.<|endoftext|>
|0| Bring me death! Bring me glory! My master, my lord, I'mhere! Come to me. I'm waiting here for you. He has promised me aglorious death. Give it to me now. I want him to know my devotion.<|endoftext|>
|0| Anything to do with you? How's it going?<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't talk to the clown.<|endoftext|>
|0| Praise him. Praise him.<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory, he's in!<|endoftext|>
|0| Let his name be the last thing I hear. Let his breath on myskin be the last thing I feel. I was lost in shadows, but he found me.<|endoftext|>
|0| His love was a beacon that led me from darkness to light, andnow I am blinded by his majesty. Humbled by his glory! Praise<|endoftext|>
|1| That's quite enough of that.<|endoftext|>
|0| Him.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's going on? You lied to me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Calm down, Howie. This is for your own good.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, at least stand where I can see you.<|endoftext|>
|0| I've been told not to speak to you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't mean you can't listen.<|endoftext|>
|1| Nothing personal. I just think we shouldtake things slowly. Get to know each other. You take people's mostprimal fears and pop it in a room. A tailor-made hell, just for them.Why?<|endoftext|>
|1| Did you say they take? Ah, what is that word? The guard? No,the warden? This is a prison.<|endoftext|>
|0| You were right, you know. Chances are, ifyou hand me over, he'll leave you alone.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, well, we saw how that idea got shot down in flames.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's not like chucking me out of a plane to lighten the load.I'm asking you for this. I'm begging you.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're possessed. You'd say anything.<|endoftext|>
|0| Possessed guys can be quite strong. Who's to say I didn'toverpower you?<|endoftext|>
|1| So what are we, cell mates? Lunch? We arenot ripe. This is what Joe said, that we weren't ready. So, what, what,you make us ready. You what? Replace? Replace what, fear? You havelived so long even your name is lost. You want this to stop. Becauseyou are just instinct. Then tell me. Tell me how to fight you.<|endoftext|>
|0| My master, my lord. I'm here!<|endoftext|>
|0| That's Howie.<|endoftext|>
|0| He's got out.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, bring me death.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, no, no, no, no! Rory, watch out!<|endoftext|>
|1| Stay back!<|endoftext|>
|1| Pond, bring the fish.<|endoftext|>
|0| What, the fish? Oh, the fish.<|endoftext|>
|1| Where'd he go?<|endoftext|>
|0| Somebody hit me. Was it Amy?<|endoftext|>
|0| We should find the Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Praise him. Praise him.<|endoftext|>
|0| You shouldn't have done that. What did you see?<|endoftext|>
|0| Nothing. Nothing. I don't know. It was weird.<|endoftext|>
|0| Come on.<|endoftext|>
|0| He got free. He overpowered me. It might leave us alone now.Maybe now we'll be safe. Wait!<|endoftext|>
|1| Have you found your room yet?<|endoftext|>
|0| No. No. Is that good or bad?<|endoftext|>
|1| Maybe you're not scared of anything.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, after all the time I spent with you in the Tardis, what wasleft to be scared of?<|endoftext|>
|1| You said that in the past tense.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, I didn't. You know, Howie had been in speech therapy. He'djust got over this massive stammer. What an achievement. I mean, canyou imagine? I'd forgotten not all victories are about saving theuniverse.<|endoftext|>
|1| Rita! Brilliant! How are you? Notpanicking, are you? Good, good. Because I am literally an otter'stoenail away from getting us out of here.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why?<|endoftext|>
|1| Excellent question. Excellent question. Why what?<|endoftext|>
|1| Why is it up to you to save us? That's quite a God complex youhave there.<|endoftext|>
|1| I brought them here. They'd say it was their choice, but offera child a suitcase full of sweets and they'll take it. Offer someoneall of time and space and they'll take that, too. Which is why youshouldn't. Which is why grown-ups were invented.<|endoftext|>
|0| All of time and space, eh?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, yeah. And when we get out of this, I'll show you too.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't know what you're talking about, but whatever it was, Ihave a feeling you just did it again.<|endoftext|>
|1| Right down to the smallest detail. Got you, Mister Minotaur.<|endoftext|>
|0| Praise him.<|endoftext|>
|0| Praise him. Praise him. Praise him.Praise him. Praise him. Praise him. Praise him. Praise him.<|endoftext|>
|1| Of course. Who else?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, you beauty. Come on, big fellow, where are you? Rita, whereare you going?<|endoftext|>
|1| Come on, come on, come on! Come on.<|endoftext|>
|1| Rita, where are you going? Can you take the phone into thecorridor? Will it reach?<|endoftext|>
|1| You started to praise it, didn't you?<|endoftext|>
|1| Rita, come back, please. We'll find a way to stop it, I swearto you.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, I need to get as far away from you all aspossible.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, no, no, you don't. The creature only wants whoever'spraising it.<|endoftext|>
|0| And then you'll put yourself in its way.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm coming to get you. Block out the fear and stay focused onyour belief.<|endoftext|>
|0| The hotel will keep us apart. I could be fifty milesaway by now.<|endoftext|>
|0| I want you to do me one last favour, Doctor. I canfeel the rapture approaching, like a wave. I don't want you to witnessthis. I want you to remember me the way I was.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's going on? Rita's disappeared. What's she doing there?<|endoftext|>
|1| Rita. Rita, please. Let me find you.<|endoftext|>
|0| You stay where you are. Please, let me be robbed ofmy faith in private.<|endoftext|>
|1| Look, Rita. Rita. Go into the room. Lock the door.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm not frightened. I'm blessed, Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm at peace.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm going to hang up.<|endoftext|>
|1| No. No, no, Rita.<|endoftext|>
|0| Goodbye, Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| Rita!<|endoftext|>
|0| Thank you for trying.<|endoftext|>
|1| Rita, please! Please! Please.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay. It preys on people's fear and possesses them. But Ritawasn't afraid. She was brave and calm. Maybe it's something to do withthe people, some connection between the four of you that'll tell me howto fight it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, you keep saying that, but you never do. And while we wait,people keep dying. And we'll be next.<|endoftext|>
|0| Look, he'll work it out. He always does. Just let him riff andmove anything expensive out of his way.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, no. Oh, no, no.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, what is wrong?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's not fear. It's faith. Not just religious faith, faith insomething. Howard believed in conspiracies, that external forcescontrolled the world. Joe had dice cufflinks and a chain with ahorseshoe. He was a gambler. Gamblers believe in luck, an intangibleforce that helps them win or lose. Gibbis has rejected any personalautonomy and is waiting for the next batch of invaders to oppress himand tell him what to do. They all believe there's something guidingthem, about to save them. That's what it replaces. Every time someonewas confronted with their most primal fear, they fell back on theirmost fundamental faith. And all this time, I have been telling you todig deep, find the thing that keeps you brave. I made you expose yourfaith, show them what they needed.<|endoftext|>
|0| But why us? Why are we here?<|endoftext|>
|1| It doesn't want you. That's why it kept showing you a way out.You're not religious or superstitious, so there's no faith for you tofall back on. It wants her.<|endoftext|>
|0| Me? Why?<|endoftext|>
|1| Your faith in me. That's what brought us here.<|endoftext|>
|0| But why do they lose their faith before they die and startworshipping it?<|endoftext|>
|1| It needs to convert the faith into a form it can consume. Faithis an energy, the specific emotional energy the creature needs to live.Which is why at the end of her note, Lucy said<|endoftext|>
|0| Praise him.<|endoftext|>
|1| Exactly.<|endoftext|>
|0| No. Oh, please, no.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy? What are you doing?<|endoftext|>
|0| He is beautiful.<|endoftext|>
|0| Leave her! Just leave her!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, it's happening. It's changing me. It's changing mythoughts.<|endoftext|>
|1| I can't save you from this. There's nothing I can do to stopthis.<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|1| I stole your childhood and now I've led you by the hand to yourdeath. But the worst thing is, I knew. I knew this would happen. Thisis what always happens.<|endoftext|>
|1| Forget your faith in me. I took you with me because I was vain.Because I wanted to be adored. Look at you. Glorious Pond, the girl whowaited for me. I'm not a hero. I really am just a mad man in a box. Andit's time we saw each other as we really are.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy Williams, it's time to stop waiting.<|endoftext|>
|1| I severed the food supply, sacrificing their faith in me. Igave you the space to die. Shush, shush.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is it, a minotaur or an alien? Or analien minotaur? That's not a question I thought I'd be asking thismorning.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's both, actually. Yeah. Here we go.<|endoftext|>
|1| Distant cousin of the Nimon. They descend on planets and setthemselves up as gods to be worshipped. Which is fine, until theinhabitants get all secular and advanced enough to build bonkersprisons.<|endoftext|>
|0| Correction. Prisons in space.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where are the guards?<|endoftext|>
|1| No need for any. It's all automated. It drifts through space,snatching people with belief systems and converts their faith into foodfor the creature.<|endoftext|>
|0| See that planet there?<|endoftext|>
|0| Which one?<|endoftext|>
|0| There. The grey one there.<|endoftext|>
|0| Mmm hmm.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's where I'm from.<|endoftext|>
|0| It didn't want just me, so you must believe in some god orsomeone, or they'd have shown you the door too. So what do Time Lordspray to?<|endoftext|>
|1| According to the in-flight recorder, the programme developedglitches. It got stuck on the same setting, the fears from the peoplebefore us weren't tidied away.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's it saying?<|endoftext|>
|1| An ancient creature, drenched in the blood of the innocent,drifting in space through an endless, shifting maze. For such acreature, death would be a gift. Then accept it, and sleep well. Iwasn't talking about myself.<|endoftext|>
|0| Could I have a lift? Just to the nearest galaxy would do.<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't tell me. This isn't Earth, that isn't a real house. Andinside lives a goblin, who feeds on indecision.<|endoftext|>
|1| No. Real Earth, real house, real door keys.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're not serious?<|endoftext|>
|0| The car too? But, that's my favourite car. How did you know thatwas my favourite car?<|endoftext|>
|1| You showed me a picture of it once and said this is myfavourite car.<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory, can you give us two minutes? Two minutes?<|endoftext|>
|0| She'll say that we can't accept it because it's too extravagantand we'll always feel a crippling sense of obligation. It's a risk I'mwilling to take.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hey.<|endoftext|>
|0| So. You're leaving, aren't you?<|endoftext|>
|1| You haven't seen the last of me. Bad Penny is my middle name.Seriously, the looks I get when I fill in a form, it's<|endoftext|>
|0| Why now?<|endoftext|>
|1| Because you're still breathing.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, I think this is about the washing up, personally.<|endoftext|>
|1| I mean, you're right, there's still heaps of stuff out there tolook at. Do you know, there's a planet whose name literally translatesas Volatile Circus? Or maybe there's a bigger, scarier adventurewaiting for you in there.<|endoftext|>
|0| Even so, it can't happen like this. After everything we've beenthrough, Doctor. Everything. You can't just drop me off at my house andsay goodbye like we've shared a cab.<|endoftext|>
|1| And what's the alternative? Me standing over your grave? Overyour broken body? Over Rory's body?<|endoftext|>
|0| If you bump into my daughter, tell her to visit her old mumsometime.<|endoftext|>
|1| And look after him.<|endoftext|>
|0| Look after you. Bye.<|endoftext|>
|0| What happened? What's he doing?<|endoftext|>
|0| He's saving us.<|endoftext|>
|0| Thank you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Better cash up then. Suppose John Joe can just wait for me.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, I'll do it. You head off.<|endoftext|>
|0| When's the council going to fix this? Last night my telly wentoff in the middle of Top Model.<|endoftext|>
|0| John Joe's waiting. I'll do the changing rooms, too.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, thanks, Shona.<|endoftext|>
|0| There's a list on the fridge.<|endoftext|>
|0| I saw it.<|endoftext|>
|0| And I've labelled the food and sort of numbered it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sophie, you don't need to number food.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's just a suggestion. Also, my mum might phone.<|endoftext|>
|0| Might?<|endoftext|>
|0| And your Mum, and my Dad, and you know, just some people.<|endoftext|>
|0| I can cope on my own. Now, please go and have a rest. You needit. I love you.<|endoftext|>
|0| I love you, too. And thank you for this. And I do know you cancope on your own. And I may have drawn some arrows in the fridge.<|endoftext|>
|0| You really have to go now.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, Kelly.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello? Sorry, we need to close up. Two minutes, okay?<|endoftext|>
|0| Mum, it's not just you. I'm phoningeverybody. I'm texting the world. Craig Owens can do it on his own. Noone is coming to help me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Mum, I'm going to have to call you back. I'm coping. I'm copingon my own. I'm coping on my own!<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm coping on my own!<|endoftext|>
|1| Hello, Craig. I'm back.<|endoftext|>
|0| She didn't. How could she phone you?<|endoftext|>
|1| How could who phone me? Nobody phoned me, I'm just here. Oh,you've redecorated. I don't like it.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's a different house. We moved.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, that's it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, what are you doing here?<|endoftext|>
|1| Social call. Thought it was about time I tried one out. How areyou?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm fine.<|endoftext|>
|1| This is the bit where I say I'm fine too, isn't it? I'm fine,too. Good. Love to Sophie. Bye.<|endoftext|>
|1| Something's wrong.<|endoftext|>
|1| On your own, you said. But you're not.You're not on your own.<|endoftext|>
|0| Just shush.<|endoftext|>
|1| Increased sulphur emissions. And look at the state of thisplace. What are you not telling me?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, please.<|endoftext|>
|1| Shush.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, you shush.<|endoftext|>
|1| Shush!<|endoftext|>
|0| Shush!<|endoftext|>
|1| No, you shush!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello, who's in there?<|endoftext|>
|1| Whatever you are, get off this planet.<|endoftext|>
|0| Whaaaa!!<|endoftext|>
|0| You've woken him!<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello? Are you all right?<|endoftext|>
|1| So when you say on your own<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, I meant on my own with the baby. Yes. Because no one thinksI can cope on my own. Which is so unfair, because I can't cope on myown with him. I can't. He just cries all the time. I mean, do they haveoff switches?<|endoftext|>
|1| Human beings. No. Believe me, I've checked.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, babies.<|endoftext|>
|1| Same difference. Sometimes this works though. Shush.<|endoftext|>
|0| Can you teach me to do that?<|endoftext|>
|1| Probably not.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, please. Come on, I need something. I'm rubbish at this.<|endoftext|>
|1| At what?<|endoftext|>
|0| Being a dad. You read all the books, and they tell you you'llknow what to do if you follow your instincts. I have no instinct.That's what this weekend's about, trying to prove to people I can dothis one thing well.<|endoftext|>
|1| So, what did you call him? Will I blush?<|endoftext|>
|0| No, we didn't call him the Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, I didn't think you would.<|endoftext|>
|0| He's called Alfie. What are you doing here anyway?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, he likes that, Alfie, though personally he prefers to becalled Stormageddon, Dark Lord Of All.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry, what?<|endoftext|>
|1| That's what he calls himself.<|endoftext|>
|0| And how do you know that?<|endoftext|>
|1| I speak baby.<|endoftext|>
|0| Of course you do. I don't even know when his nappy needschanging, and I'm the one supposed to be his dad. Oh.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah. He's wondering where his mum is? Where is Sophie?<|endoftext|>
|0| She's gone away with Melina for the weekend. She needs a rest.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, he's your dad. You can't just call him Not Mum.<|endoftext|>
|0| Not Mum?<|endoftext|>
|1| That's you. Also Not Mum, that's me. And everybody else ispeasants. That's a bit unfortunate.<|endoftext|>
|0| What are you here for? What's happening?<|endoftext|>
|1| I just popped in to say hello.<|endoftext|>
|0| You don't do that. I checked upstairs when we moved, it's real.And next door, both sides, they're humans. Is it the fridge? Are therealiens in my fridge?<|endoftext|>
|1| I just want to see you, Craig! Cross my hearts. I've beenknocking about on my own for a bit. Bit of a farewell tour. One lastthing, popping in to see you, then I'm off to the Alignment of Exedor.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Alignment of Exedor?<|endoftext|>
|1| Seventeen galaxies in perfect unison. Meant to be spectacular.I can't miss it. Literally can't. It's locked in a time stasis field. Iget one crack at flying my Tardis straight into it, if I get my datesright. Which I have.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sounds nice.<|endoftext|>
|1| So this is me, popping in and popping out again. Just beingsocial. Just having a laugh. Never mind that.<|endoftext|>
|0| Never mind what?<|endoftext|>
|1| Nothing.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, you've noticed something. You've got your noticing face on.I have nightmares about that face.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ooo, nope, given up all that. Done noticing things. I didn'teven notice that, for example. Well, got to go. Good seeing you, Craig.Goodbye, Stormageddon.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, no, wait, wait. Can you do the shushing thing?<|endoftext|>
|1| No, it only works once, and only on life forms withunderdeveloped brains.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hang on. You said farewell tour. What do you mean, farewell?<|endoftext|>
|1| Shush.<|endoftext|>
|1| It goes up tiddly up, it goes down tiddly down for only fortynine ninety nine, which I personally think is a bit steep, but thenagain it's your parents' cash and they'll only waste it on boring stufflike lamps and vegetables. Yawn!<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, Soph. Just enjoy your holiday. Yeah, coping.<|endoftext|>
|1| Nobody panic, but I appear to be losing control.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, love you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oops. Guys, guys, ladies and gentlemen. While I deal with thisawkward moment, you go and find your parents slash guardians. Try inlamps. Craig!<|endoftext|>
|0| What the hell are you doing here?<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm the Doctor. I work in a shop now. Here to help. Look, theygave me a badge with my name on in case I forget who I am. Verythoughtful, as that does happen.<|endoftext|>
|0| You were leaving. The Alignment of Exeter, what about that? Onechance to see it, you said.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, I was on my way, you know. Saw a shop, got a job. You gotto live in the moment. Craig, mind Yappy.<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yappy. The robot dog. Not so much fun as I remember. You lookawful.<|endoftext|>
|0| I haven't slept, have I? I still can't stop him crying. I eventried singing to him last night.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, he did mention that he thought you were crying, too. Hedidn't get a wink. Yappy, say goodbye to Craig and Stormageddon.Goodbye, Craig. Goodbye, Stormageddon.<|endoftext|>
|1| What was that?<|endoftext|>
|0| You're here for a reason, aren't you? You noticed something, andyou're investigating it. And because it's you, it's going to bedangerous and alien.<|endoftext|>
|1| Might not be.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, I live here. I need to know.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, you don't.<|endoftext|>
|0| My baby lives here. My son.<|endoftext|>
|1| Sheila Clark went missing Tuesday. Atif Ghosh last seen Friday.Tom Luker last seen Sunday.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why's none of this on the front page?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, page one has an exclusive on Nina, a local girl who gotkicked off Britain's Got Talent. These people are on pages seven,nineteen, twenty two. Because no one's noticed yet. They're far tooexcited about Nina's emotional journey, which in fairness, is quiteinspiring.<|endoftext|>
|0| And what else?<|endoftext|>
|1| These funny old power fluctuations whichjust happen to coincide with the disappearances.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's just the council putting in new cables, isn't it?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh yes, that's it. Mystery solved. Wasting my time. Now, youcan go home and I can go to Exedor. Goodbye.<|endoftext|>
|1| And here's the lift.<|endoftext|>
|0| It says it's out of order.<|endoftext|>
|1| Not any more. See? Here to help.<|endoftext|>
|0| It says danger.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, rubbish. Lifts aren't dangerous.<|endoftext|>
|0| Do I look like I'm stupid?<|endoftext|>
|1| Quiet, Stormy. Oh, all right. There's more.<|endoftext|>
|1| Just between you, me and Stormy, don't wantto frighten me punters. Someone's been using a teleport relay righthere in this shop. Missing people last seen in this area. Before youask, CCTV's been wiped.<|endoftext|>
|0| A teleport? A teleport? A teleport like, a beam me up teleport,like you see in Star Trek?<|endoftext|>
|1| Exactly. Someone's been using a beam me up Star Trek teleport.Could be disguised as anything.<|endoftext|>
|0| But a teleport in a shop? That's ridiculous.<|endoftext|>
|0| What was that? Was that the lights again?<|endoftext|>
|1| (strangled) Yes, that's it. That's all. It's the lights.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why did you say that like that?<|endoftext|>
|1| Like what?<|endoftext|>
|0| Like that, in that high pitched voice.<|endoftext|>
|1| Just keep looking at me, Craig. Right at me. Just keep looking.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, because, because, because I love you.<|endoftext|>
|0| You love me?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, Craig. It's you. It's always been you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Me?<|endoftext|>
|1| Is that so surprising?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, are you going to kiss me?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, Craig. Yes, I am. Would you like that? Bit out ofpractice, but I've had some wonderful feedback.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, no. I can't. I'm taken.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, my God!<|endoftext|>
|1| Or we could just hold hands if it make you'd feel morecomfortable.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is happening?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, first of all, I don't really love you, except as afriend.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is that?<|endoftext|>
|1| Quick reverse.<|endoftext|>
|0| What the hell just happened?<|endoftext|>
|1| They must have linked the teleport relay tothe lift, but I've fused it. They can't use that again. Stuck up thereon their spaceship.<|endoftext|>
|0| What were those things?<|endoftext|>
|1| Cybermen.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ship. A spaceship. We were in space?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's got to be up there somewhere. Can't get a fix. It must beshielded.<|endoftext|>
|0| But you fused the teleport. You sorted it. They can't come back.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, no, no, I've just bought myself a little time. Still got towork out what they're doing before I can stop it.<|endoftext|>
|0| But if they've got the teleport and they're that evil, whyhaven't they invaded already?<|endoftext|>
|1| Craig, take Alfie and go.<|endoftext|>
|0| No.<|endoftext|>
|1| No?<|endoftext|>
|0| No. I remember from last time, people got killed. People thatdidn't know you. I know where it's safest for me and Alfie, and that'sright next to you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Is that so?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah. You always win. You always survive.<|endoftext|>
|1| Those were the days.<|endoftext|>
|0| I can help you. I'm staying.<|endoftext|>
|1| Craig. Craig. All right. All right, maybe those days aren'tquite over yet. Let's go and investigate. I mean, there's no immediatedanger now.<|endoftext|>
|1| Good afternoon, Val.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where am I investigating?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, look round. Ask questions. People like it when you'rewith a baby. Babies are sweet. People talk to you. That's why I usuallytake a human with me.<|endoftext|>
|0| So, I'm your baby?<|endoftext|>
|1| You're my baby.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hope you don't mind me saying, Doctor, but I think you look everso sweet, you and your partner and the baby.<|endoftext|>
|1| Partner. Yes, I like it. Is it better than companion?<|endoftext|>
|0| Companion sounds old-fashioned. There's no need to be coy thesedays.<|endoftext|>
|1| You've not noticed anything unusual around here lately, Val?<|endoftext|>
|0| Well<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, yes?<|endoftext|>
|0| Mary Warnock saw Don Petheridge snogging Andrea Groom outside theConservative Club on his so-called day off golfing.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah. Maybe this wasn't such a good idea after all.<|endoftext|>
|0| And then there's that silver rat thing.<|endoftext|>
|1| What?<|endoftext|>
|0| All right, Alfie, you watch Daddy investigate. You look cute,I'll do the talking.<|endoftext|>
|0| Good afternoon, sir. Can I help you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Hiya. I'm Craig.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah?<|endoftext|>
|0| Do you mind if I just ask you some questions.<|endoftext|>
|0| You what?<|endoftext|>
|0| Just between me and you, in confidence, have you noticedanything unusual? Interesting?<|endoftext|>
|0| You what?<|endoftext|>
|0| Talk to me about ladies wear.<|endoftext|>
|0| George!<|endoftext|>
|0| Hi, George. Nice uniform.<|endoftext|>
|1| A silver rat, glowing red eyes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes. Then it zizzed off. I wanted to get one for my nephew, butstockroom say there's no such item.<|endoftext|>
|1| I bet they do.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, what was it then? Answer me that.<|endoftext|>
|0| Can I help you, sir?<|endoftext|>
|0| Have you seen how cute my baby is? Look at his face. I'm goingto head off, actually. All right, whoa.<|endoftext|>
|0| Whoa!<|endoftext|>
|0| What's all that hullabaloo?<|endoftext|>
|1| Er, that'll be my partner with the er<|endoftext|>
|0| Ah.<|endoftext|>
|0| Make a habit of hanging round in women's wear, sir?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm sorry. Oh, shush. Alfie, come on.<|endoftext|>
|0| He's a pervert. Look at him.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hello, everyone. Here to help.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello, Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello, Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hello. Has anyone seen a silver rat? No. Okay. Long shot. I seeyou've met my friend, Craig. Nice uniform, George.<|endoftext|>
|0| Thank you, Doctor. If he's with you, that's all right, then.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry. I thought he was hassling me, because that's the lastthing I need today, because Shona's not turned up, right, so I'm doingtwice the work for the same money, if you don't mind.<|endoftext|>
|1| Shush.<|endoftext|>
|0| Please teach me how to do that.<|endoftext|>
|1| No. Hold on. Un-shush. Shona?<|endoftext|>
|0| My supervisor. She's meant to be in today but never showed up.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, where did you last see her?<|endoftext|>
|0| How do you do that? It's a power, isn't it.Some sort of weird alien hypnotic power. I bet you excrete some sort ofgas that makes people love you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Would that I could, Craig.<|endoftext|>
|1| Er, sorry, Madam. I'd try that in red if I were you.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm right though, aren't I?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, you love me, I've never excreted any weird alien gases atyou.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't love you. Don't start that again.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, I know. Course he does. Of course you do. We're partners.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, but I did exactly what you would have done, and I nearlygot arrested.<|endoftext|>
|1| Stormy thinks you should believe in yourself more.<|endoftext|>
|0| Great. So now my baby's reviewing me.<|endoftext|>
|1| Here. Right here. Last night. A Cyberman took Shona.<|endoftext|>
|0| A Cyberman? I thought it was a little silver rat.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's not a rat. It's a Cybermat.<|endoftext|>
|0| All right. Don't have a go at me just because I don't know thenames.<|endoftext|>
|1| Cybermats are infiltrators. Very small,very deadly. They collect power like bees collect pollen. One of them'sbeen sucking the electrical energy from this area. But why a shop? Youknow, why not a nuclear power station?<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, why?<|endoftext|>
|1| Let's ask it. We wait for the shop to shut. We stake the placeout and grab ourselves a Cybermat.<|endoftext|>
|0| And this is just a coincidence, is it?<|endoftext|>
|1| What is?<|endoftext|>
|0| Aliens in Colchester. Aliens twice in my life, happening to me,just when you turn up.<|endoftext|>
|1| Whoa, whoa, whoa. This is not my fault, Craig.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, shush. Look what you've done now.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's his nappy. He's mentioned it twice.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well sorry, I don't speak baby, do I.<|endoftext|>
|1| There's a changing station over by Electrical Goods.<|endoftext|>
|0| And of course, you'd know that. Come on, Alfie.<|endoftext|>
|1| Craig! It's a coincidence. It happens. It's what the universedoes for<|endoftext|>
|0| Can I have your autograph, please?<|endoftext|>
|0| Er, yeah. Sure.<|endoftext|>
|1| Fun.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's your name?<|endoftext|>
|0| Elly.<|endoftext|>
|0| To Elly. I like your hairband.<|endoftext|>
|0| Thank you.<|endoftext|>
|0| All right?<|endoftext|>
|0| There you go.<|endoftext|>
|0| Thank you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amelia Pond.<|endoftext|>
|1| Right, let's be having you then, Cybermat.<|endoftext|>
|1| Shush.<|endoftext|>
|0| Can't you put that on quiet?<|endoftext|>
|1| No. It's a sonic screwdriver. Sonic equals sound. Take this. Igot it on my discount, ten percent off. It's a papoose.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why do I need a papoose?<|endoftext|>
|1| Alfie wants you attached to him. You are far too slow when hesummons you.<|endoftext|>
|0| When's he going to stop giving me marks?<|endoftext|>
|1| Never. That's parenthood. Couldn't you have just got ababysitter? No, any babysitter. Doesn't have to be a hot one.<|endoftext|>
|0| I told everyone I know I didn't need their help this weekend.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well.<|endoftext|>
|0| They won't even answer my calls. I didn't know there was goingto be an invasion of Cyberman.<|endoftext|>
|1| Shush.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's okay.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah ha! That's very odd. It must be on low power. Or I'm betterat that than I remember.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, is that it?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, that's quite cute. Look at that. Look, Alfie, look.<|endoftext|>
|0| Argh!<|endoftext|>
|0| Metal rat, real mouth! Metal rat, real mouth.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, I know it is.<|endoftext|>
|0| Metal rat, real mouth.<|endoftext|>
|1| Stop screaming. Stop, stop screaming. Shush.<|endoftext|>
|1| Come on!<|endoftext|>
|1| George!<|endoftext|>
|1| George<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor! Doctor! Doctor! What happened?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, I've been, I've been chipped, chapped, chopped. TheCyberman. It killed George, took him back to the ship.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Cybermen are here? But you said<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, I know what I said. I say a lot of things. But I fusedthe teleport. It should have taken them days to repair.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you okay?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, I should be dead, but the arm it chopped me with, it wasdamaged. Old spare parts. Must have changed those missing people.<|endoftext|>
|0| They've changed the missing into Cybermen? Why didn't theychange you?<|endoftext|>
|1| A long story. I'm not exactly compatible. But why are theyusing spare parts? Why? Everything I find out makes less sense.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, listen to me. If the Cybermen are here, then we're notsafe. We've got to go. We've got to go back to base.<|endoftext|>
|1| We've got a base? When did we get a base?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm going down the shop. We've run out of milk. You know what todo if he cries.<|endoftext|>
|1| No.<|endoftext|>
|0| Me neither.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hello, Stormageddon. It's the Doctor. Hereto help. Shush. Hey. There, there. Be quiet. Go to sleep. Really. Stopcrying. You've got a lot to look forward to, you know. A normal humanlife on Earth. Mortgage repayments, the nine to five, a persistentnagging sense of spiritual emptiness. Save the tears for later, boy-o.Oh, no. That was crabby. No, that was old. But I am old, Stormy. I amso old. So near the end.<|endoftext|>
|1| You, Alfie Owens, you are so young, aren't you? And, you know,right now, everything's ahead of you. You could be anything. Yes, Iknow. You could walk among the stars. They don't actually look likethat, you know. They are rather more impressive.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah. You know, when I was little like you, I dreamt of thestars. I think it's fair to say in the language of your age, that Ilived my dream, I owned the stage, gave it a hundred and ten percent. Ihope you have as much fun as I did, Alfie.<|endoftext|>
|1| Your dad's trying his best, you know. Yes, I know it's not hisfault he doesn't have mammary glands. No, neither do I. Alfie, why isthere a sinister beeping coming from behind me?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, no you don't.<|endoftext|>
|1| Come on, Alfie. Run! It's only stunned.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's going to be okay. Good Alfie. Yes.Don't worry about anything. We're going to go outside.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oops.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm back!<|endoftext|>
|1| Come on, Craig, pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor? Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|1| Craig? Don't worry. Alfie is fine. But on no account enter thehouse.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|1| No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!<|endoftext|>
|0| Help me!<|endoftext|>
|0| Where's Alfie? Where's Alfie?<|endoftext|>
|1| He's safe. He's safe!<|endoftext|>
|0| Get it off me!<|endoftext|>
|1| I think I can find the right frequency, shut it down again!<|endoftext|>
|0| Kill it!<|endoftext|>
|1| All right, all right, all right! Move!<|endoftext|>
|1| Argh! Baking tray, Craig. Baking tray!<|endoftext|>
|1| Hold it down!<|endoftext|>
|0| Get on with it!<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah, it must be shielded from metastatic energy. Of course.<|endoftext|>
|0| Of course.<|endoftext|>
|1| Don't worry, I have an app for that. Stand back. Stand back!<|endoftext|>
|1| Success. That was amazing. You must be really, really strong.That thing should have had you easily.<|endoftext|>
|0| Is it definitely dead?<|endoftext|>
|1| Inactive, yes. Technically never been alive. It was playingpossum before, to take us by surprise. Bravo.<|endoftext|>
|0| Phew. Alfie!<|endoftext|>
|0| (yawns) I'm knackered. That thing was eating up the electricity?<|endoftext|>
|1| And transmitting it up to the Cybership. But why? Why do theyneed power? Why are those conversions not complete yet, and what arethey doing up there?<|endoftext|>
|0| You said you were going to look at its brain.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, I had to wipe its brain. Now I can reprogram it and use itas a weapon against them.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Cybermat came after us?<|endoftext|>
|1| No, after me.<|endoftext|>
|0| They sent it after us.<|endoftext|>
|1| After me. Because of me, you and Alfie nearly died. Do youstill feel safe with me, Craig?<|endoftext|>
|0| You can't help who your mates are.<|endoftext|>
|1| No. I am a stupid, selfish man. Always have been. I should havemade you go. I should never have come here.<|endoftext|>
|0| What would have happened if you hadn't come? Who else knowsabout the Cybermen and teleports?<|endoftext|>
|1| I put people in danger.<|endoftext|>
|0| Stop beating yourself up. If it weren't for you, this wholeplanet would be an absolute ruin.<|endoftext|>
|1| Craig, very soon I won't be here. My time is running out. Idon't mean Exedor. Silence will fall when the question is asked. Don'teven know what the question is. I always knew I'd die still asking.Thing is, Craig, it's tomorrow. Can't put it off any more. Tomorrow isthe day I<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah.<|endoftext|>
|1| Safe mode. Clever me. Come along, Bitey.<|endoftext|>
|0| So I'll be back about ten, because Melina's totally goneoff on one. She's going to kill David Jenkins. I know I'm stupid toworry. I can't wait to get home to my special boys!<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, no, no, no, no.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|0| Love you, Alfie. Love you, Craig.<|endoftext|>
|0| You idiot!<|endoftext|>
|0| Morning!<|endoftext|>
|1| Morning. Teleport's still fused. They didn't repair it. So, theCyberman last night. How did it get down here, how did it get out? Andwhy, why, am I asking you?<|endoftext|>
|0| You found the silver rat?<|endoftext|>
|1| But where are the silver men?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm sorry, Alfie, I can't leave you here on your own. There'ssomething up with the Doctor, and we owe him. I wouldn't have you orMummy if it wasn't for him. He needs someone. He always needs someone.He just can't admit it. I promise nothing's going to happen to you. Allright, come on, here we go.<|endoftext|>
|1| Secondary teleport. No, there is no otherteleport. They must have had a back-up system. Something complicated,something powerful, something shielded. Something like a door? A door!A disillium bonded steel door disguised as a wall.<|endoftext|>
|1| That is cheating. So, it didn't teleport down, it climbed up.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, well, well. You have been busy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor? Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|0| Another row? He went in the changing rooms. Something about silvermen.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, God, no. Val, I need you to look after Alfie for me, okay?Please look after him. The Doctor needs me.<|endoftext|>
|0| I understand. You two need time alone.<|endoftext|>
|0| And don't follow me!<|endoftext|>
|0| I wasn't intending to.<|endoftext|>
|0| You have come to us.<|endoftext|>
|1| Took me a while. Lot on my mind. Let's see. This ship crashedhere centuries ago. No survivors, but the systems are dormant, waitingfor power, and then the council stick a load of new cables right on topof you. Bitey wakes up and channels the power. You start crewing upfrom the shop as best you can. Not enough power, not enough parts.<|endoftext|>
|0| When we are ready, we will emerge. We will convert thisplanet to Cyberform.<|endoftext|>
|1| What, the six of you?<|endoftext|>
|0| You know that is enough. You know us. You are the Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| Correct. And the Doctor always gives you a choice. Deactivateyourself, or I deactivate you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor? Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|1| Argh!<|endoftext|>
|0| He must be the new leader.<|endoftext|>
|0| No. He is not like us. Brain and binary vascular systemincompatible. They will be discarded. Other body parts may be of use.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oi, Cybermen! Get off my planet, or I activate this.<|endoftext|>
|1| Craig, stop this. Get out!<|endoftext|>
|0| It's like you said, Doctor. Got to believe you can do it.<|endoftext|>
|0| You located us?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah. Teleport in the lift, bit rubbish. And that littleCybermat never stood a chance. So you see what you're dealing with?<|endoftext|>
|0| You are compatible. You are intelligent.<|endoftext|>
|0| Argh! No, I'm not intelligent. You don't want me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Do not fear. We will take your fear from you. You will belike us. You will be more than us.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, no, no.<|endoftext|>
|0| Your designation is CyberController. You will lead us. Wewill conquer this world.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|1| Craig!<|endoftext|>
|0| Do something, please!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| Craig, don't worry. I've reprogrammed their Cybermat. It'lldrain their power.<|endoftext|>
|0| You have failed, Doctor. Begin conversion. Phase one. Cleansethe brain of emotions.<|endoftext|>
|1| No. Craig, fight it! They can't convert you if you fight back.You're strong. Don't give in to it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Help me!<|endoftext|>
|1| Think of Sophie. Think of Alfie. Craig, don't let them take itall away.<|endoftext|>
|0| Make it stop. Please, make it stop!<|endoftext|>
|1| Please, listen to me. I believe in you. I believe you can dothis. I've always believed in all of you, all my life. I'm going die,Craig. Tomorrow, I'm going to die, but I don't mind if you just proveme right. Craig!<|endoftext|>
|0| Begin full conversion.<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't worry, It's just a little light going out.<|endoftext|>
|0| Unknown soundwave detected.<|endoftext|>
|0| It is the sound of fear. It is irrelevant. We will remove allfear.<|endoftext|>
|1| Alfie, I'm so sorry! Alfie, please, stop. I, I can't help him.<|endoftext|>
|0| Emotions eradicated. Conversion complete. Alert. Emotionalsubsystems rebooting. This is impossible.<|endoftext|>
|1| He can hear him. He can hear Alfie. Oh, please, just give methis. Craig, you wanted a chance to prove you're a dad. You are nevergoing to get better one than this.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is happening?<|endoftext|>
|1| What's happening, you metal moron? A baby is crying. And you'dbetter watch out, because guess what? Ha ha! Daddy's coming home!<|endoftext|>
|0| Alfie! Alfie, I'm here! I'm coming for you!<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, Craig.<|endoftext|>
|0| Alfie!<|endoftext|>
|1| Alfie needs you!<|endoftext|>
|0| Emergency. Emotional influx!<|endoftext|>
|1| You've triggered a feedback loop into their emotionalinhibitors. All that stuff they cut out of themselves, now they'refeeling it. Which means a very big explosion.<|endoftext|>
|0| Overload. Overload. Overload.<|endoftext|>
|0| Get it open! We need to get to Alfie!<|endoftext|>
|1| They've sealed the ship!<|endoftext|>
|0| We've got to get out of here!<|endoftext|>
|1| I know!<|endoftext|>
|1| The teleport!<|endoftext|>
|0| How did you get in there?<|endoftext|>
|0| Alfie!<|endoftext|>
|0| Here's your daddy.<|endoftext|>
|1| That was another review. Ten out of ten.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Cybermen. They blew up. I blew them up with love.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, that's impossible. And also grossly sentimental and oversimplistic. You destroyed them because of the deeply ingrainedhereditary human trait to protect one's own genes, which in turntriggered a, a, a. Yeah. Love. You blew them up with love.<|endoftext|>
|1| The building should be totally safestructurally, and of course the bonded disillium contained theexplosion.<|endoftext|>
|0| Right. Why you telling me all this?<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't know. Shush.<|endoftext|>
|0| It suits you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Thanks.<|endoftext|>
|0| Discount applies to partners.<|endoftext|>
|0| Great.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you two married then?<|endoftext|>
|0| No, no. We talked about it, but it's just a piece of paper,isn't it?<|endoftext|>
|1| Thank you for your help, Val. Good noticing. Keep them peeled.<|endoftext|>
|0| I will. I'm glad you two made up for baby's sake.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah.<|endoftext|>
|0| How do you mean?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's nice for baby to have two daddies who love each other.<|endoftext|>
|0| Wait. Hang on a sec. Two daddies? You think I'm?<|endoftext|>
|0| His companion.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ha ha ha! Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh. Now where's he rushed off to?<|endoftext|>
|0| He's gone.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who's tidied all this up?<|endoftext|>
|1| See, I do come back.<|endoftext|>
|0| How did you?<|endoftext|>
|1| Time machine. But even with time travel, getting glaziers on aSunday. Tricky.<|endoftext|>
|0| You went back in time? That means you used up your hours. Whatabout Exedor?<|endoftext|>
|1| What about you being in trouble with Sophie when she comesback? I couldn't let that happen.<|endoftext|>
|0| You used up your time for me?<|endoftext|>
|0| He calls me dad?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, of course he does now. Yeah, I know. He's a bit thick,isn't he?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oi, shut up, you two.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, now it's time. I have to go.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, I know that something's wrong. I can help you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Nobody can help me. I hope Sophie won't mind. I need these.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where are you going to go?<|endoftext|>
|1| America.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sophie'll be home any second. Are you sure<|endoftext|>
|1| I can't miss this appointment, Craig. Goodbye, mate.<|endoftext|>
|0| Wait there. One second.<|endoftext|>
|0| From Sean's stag.<|endoftext|>
|1| Wow.<|endoftext|>
|0| You ride 'em, pardner.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, thanks.<|endoftext|>
|0| Bye.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, that will be Sophie arriv<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello, hello, I forgot my keys.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, I've missed you so much.<|endoftext|>
|0| I missed you, too. Both of you. Are you wearing a papoose?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, my God, the place is spotless. Hasanything happened? You look different.<|endoftext|>
|0| Nothing happened. Nothing weird.<|endoftext|>
|0| Look at you two, thick as thieves. Who's Daddy's little boythen?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| What? Craig?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well then, old girl. One last trip, eh?<|endoftext|>
|1| Hey. I'm the Doctor. I was here to help. And you are very, verywelcome.<|endoftext|>
|0| It was funny. He seemed so happy, but so sad at thesame time.<|endoftext|>
|0| I was just a kid. I thought maybe he was a cowboy on hisway to a gunfight.<|endoftext|>
|0| I really liked his hat.<|endoftext|>
|0| Tick tock, goes the clock, and what now shall we play?Tick tock, goes the clock, now summer's gone away.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello?<|endoftext|>
|0| Such a lovely old song. But is it about him?<|endoftext|>
|0| You know about the Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|0| So very well. Oh, don't try and remember me. We've been fartoo thorough with your dear little head.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh! What are they? What are those things?<|endoftext|>
|0| Your owners.<|endoftext|>
|0| My what?<|endoftext|>
|0| So, they made you a Doctor today, did they? Doctor RiverSong. How clever you are. You understand what this is, don't you?<|endoftext|>
|0| According to some accounts, it's the day the Doctor dies.<|endoftext|>
|0| By Silencio Lake, on the Plain of Sighs, an ImpossibleAstronaut will rise from the deep and strike the Time Lord dead.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's a story.<|endoftext|>
|0| And this is where it begins.<|endoftext|>
|0| You never really escaped us, Melody Pond. We were alwayscoming for you.<|endoftext|>
|0| How do you know who I am?<|endoftext|>
|0| I made you what you are. The woman who kills the Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| No! No! No!<|endoftext|>
|0| Tick tock, goes the clock, and all the years they fly. Ticktock, and all too soon, your love will surely die.<|endoftext|>
|0| Tick tock goes the clock, the cradle now be rocked. Ticktock, goes the clock till River kills the Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| And it's another beautiful day in London. There arereports of sunspot activity and solar flares causing interferenceacross all radio signals so apologies for that. Pterodactyls fly overchildren playing in Hyde Park.)<|endoftext|>
|0| Guys, look!<|endoftext|>
|0| So do you think you can top last year'sChristmas Special?<|endoftext|>
|0| And can you tell us anything about it?<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, all I can say now is that it involves ghosts,and the past, the present and future, all at the same time.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ooo, we love a ghost story.<|endoftext|>
|0| Crowds lined the Mall today as Holy Roman Emperor,Winston Churchill, returned to the Buckingham Senate on his personalmammoth.<|endoftext|>
|0| Not too many late nights in Gaul, I hope.<|endoftext|>
|0| Just the one. I had an argument with Cleopatra. Dreadfulwoman. Excellent dancer.<|endoftext|>
|0| I can tell from your blood pressure.<|endoftext|>
|0| What time do you have, doctor?<|endoftext|>
|0| Two minutes past five, Caesar.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's always two minutes past five. Day or night, it's alwaystwo minutes past five in the afternoon. Why is that?<|endoftext|>
|0| Because that is the time, Caesar.<|endoftext|>
|0| And the date. It's always the twenty second of April. Doesit not bother you?<|endoftext|>
|0| The date and the time have always been the same, Caesar. Whyshould it start bothering me now?<|endoftext|>
|0| I want to see the Soothsayer. Where is he?<|endoftext|>
|0| In the Tower, where you threw him the last time.<|endoftext|>
|0| Get him.<|endoftext|>
|0| Leave us. Tick tock goes the clock, as the old song says.But they don't, do they? The clocks never tick. Something has happenedto time. That's what you say. What you never stop saying. All ofhistory is happening at once. But what does that mean? What happened?Explain to me in terms that I can understand what happened to time.<|endoftext|>
|1| A woman.<|endoftext|>
|1| Imagine you were dying. Imagine you were afraid and a long wayfrom home and in terrible pain. Just when you thought it couldn't getworse, you looked up and saw the face of the devil himself. Hello,Dalek.<|endoftext|>
|0| Emergency. Emergency. Weapon system disabled. Emergency.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hush, now. I need some information from your data core.Everything the Daleks know about the Silence.<|endoftext|>
|1| Gideon Vandaleur. Get him. Now.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who says he's here?<|endoftext|>
|1| Father Gideon Vandaleur, former envoy of the Silence. Mycondolences.<|endoftext|>
|0| Your what?<|endoftext|>
|1| Gideon Vandaleur has been dead for six months.<|endoftext|>
|1| Can I speak to the Captain, please?<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello again, the Teselectatime-travelling shape-changing robot powered by miniaturised people.Never get bored of that. Long time since Berlin.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, what have you done to our systems?<|endoftext|>
|0| They'll be fine if you behave. Now, this unitcan disguise itself as anyone in the universe, so if you're posing asVandaleur, you're investigating the Silence. Tell me about them.<|endoftext|>
|0| Tell you what?<|endoftext|>
|0| One thing. Just one. Their weakest link.<|endoftext|>
|1| The crowd are getting restless. They know the Queen is youronly legal move, except you've already moved it twelve times, whichmeans there are now over four million volts running through it. That'swhy they call it Live Chess. Even with the gauntlet you'll never makeit to Bishop Four alive.<|endoftext|>
|0| I am a dead man, unless you concede the game.<|endoftext|>
|1| But I'm winning.<|endoftext|>
|0| Name your price.<|endoftext|>
|1| Information.<|endoftext|>
|0| I work for the Silence. They would kill me.<|endoftext|>
|1| They're going to kill me too, very soon. I was just going tolie down and take it, but you know what? Before I go, I'd like to knowwhy I have to die.<|endoftext|>
|0| Dorium Maldovar is the only one who can help you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Dorium's dead. The Monks beheaded him at Demon's Run.<|endoftext|>
|0| I know. Concede the game, Doctor, and I'll take you to him.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Seventh Transept, where the Headless Monks keep theleftovers. Watch your step. There are traps everywhere.<|endoftext|>
|1| I hate rats.<|endoftext|>
|0| There are no rats in the transept.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, good.<|endoftext|>
|0| The skulls eat them.<|endoftext|>
|0| The headless monks behead you alive, remember.<|endoftext|>
|1| Why are some of them in boxes?<|endoftext|>
|0| Because some people are rich, and some people are left to rot.And Dorium Maldovar was always very rich.<|endoftext|>
|1| Thank you for bringing me, Gantok.<|endoftext|>
|0| My pleasure. It saves me the trouble of burying you. Nobodybeats me at chess.<|endoftext|>
|1| Gantok!<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello? Is someone there? Ah, Doctor. Thank God it's you. TheMonks, they turned on me.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, I'm afraid they rather did, a bit.<|endoftext|>
|0| Give it to me straight, Doctor. How bad are my injuries?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well<|endoftext|>
|0| Ha, ha! Oh, your face.<|endoftext|>
|0| This is absurd. Other worlds,carnivorous skulls, talking heads. I don't know why I'm listening toyou.<|endoftext|>
|1| Because, in another reality, you and I are friends. And yousense that. Just as you sense there is something wrong with time.<|endoftext|>
|0| You mentioned a woman.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes. I'm getting to her.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's she like? Attractive, I assume.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hell, in high heels.<|endoftext|>
|0| Tell me more.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, it's not so bad, really, as long asthey get your box the right way up. I got a media-chip fitted in myhead years ago, and the Wi-Fi down here is excellent, so I keep myselfentertained.<|endoftext|>
|1| I need to know about the Silence.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh. A religious order of great power and discretion. Thesentinels of history, as they like to call themselves.<|endoftext|>
|1| And they want me dead.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, not really. They just don't want you to remain alive.<|endoftext|>
|1| That's okay, then. I was a bit worried for a minute there.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're a man with a long and dangerous past, but your future isinfinitely more terrifying. The Silence believe it must be averted.<|endoftext|>
|1| You know, you could've told me all this the last time we met.<|endoftext|>
|0| It was a busy day and I got beheaded.<|endoftext|>
|1| What's so dangerous about my future?<|endoftext|>
|0| On the Fields of Trenzalore, at the fall of the Eleventh, whenno living creature can speak falsely, or fail to answer, a questionwill be asked. A question that must never, ever be answered.<|endoftext|>
|1| Silence will fall when the question is asked.<|endoftext|>
|0| Silence must fall would be a better translation. The Silenceare determined the question will never be answered. That the Doctorwill never reach Trenzalore.<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't understand. What's it got to do with me?<|endoftext|>
|0| The first question. The oldest question in the universe, hiddenin plain sight. Would you like to know what it is?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you sure? Very, very sure?<|endoftext|>
|1| Of course.<|endoftext|>
|0| Then I shall tell you. But on your own head be it.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's not my fault. Put me back.Ow! I've fallen on my nose. Have you got wi-fi here? I'm bored alreadyand my nose is hurting. We all have to die, Doctor, but you more thanmost. You do see that, don't you? You know what the question is now.You do see that you have to die.<|endoftext|>
|0| But what was the question? Why did itmean your death?<|endoftext|>
|1| Suppose there was a man who knew a secret. A terrible,dangerous secret that must never be told. How would you erase thatsecret from the world? Destroy it forever, before it can be spoken.<|endoftext|>
|0| If I had to, I'd destroy the man.<|endoftext|>
|1| And silence would fall. All the times I've heard those words, Inever realised it was my silence, my death. The Doctor will fall. Whyare we here?<|endoftext|>
|0| This, this is the Senate Room.<|endoftext|>
|1| Why did we leave your office?<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, we wanted a stroll, didn't we?<|endoftext|>
|1| I think I've been running. Why do you have your revolver?<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, you're dangerous company, Soothsayer.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes. I think I am.<|endoftext|>
|0| Resume your story.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, please, open my hatch.I've got an awful headache. Which to be honest means more than it usedto. It's like some terrible weight pressing down on my<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh. I see.<|endoftext|>
|1| Why Lake Silencio? Why Utah?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's a still point in time. Makes it easier to create a fixedpoint. And your death is a fixed point, Doctor. You can't run away fromthis.<|endoftext|>
|1| Been running all my life. Why should I stop?<|endoftext|>
|0| Because now you know what's at stake. Why your life must end.<|endoftext|>
|1| Not today.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's the point in delaying? How long have you delayedalready?<|endoftext|>
|1| Been knocking about. A bit of a farewell tour. Things to do,people to see. There's always more. I could invent a new colour, savethe Dodo, join the Beatles. Hello, it's me. Get him. Tell him, we'regoing out and it's all on me, except for the money and driving. I havegot a time machine, Dorium. It's all still going on. For me, it neverstops. Liz the First is still waiting in a glade to elope with me. Icould help Rose Tyler with her homework. I could go on all of Jack'sstag parties in one night.<|endoftext|>
|0| Time catches up with us all, Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, it has never laid a glove on me! Hello?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, I'm so sorry. We didn't know how tocontact you. I'm afraid Brigadier Lethbridge Stewart passed away<|endoftext|>
|0| a few months ago. Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes. Yes, I<|endoftext|>
|0| It was very peaceful. He talked a lot about you, if that'sany comfort. Always made us pour an extra brandy in case you came roundone of these days.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor? What's wrong?<|endoftext|>
|1| Nothing. Nothing. It's just.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's time. It's time.<|endoftext|>
|0| Surely you could deliver the messagesyourself?<|endoftext|>
|1| It would involve crossing my own time stream. Best not.<|endoftext|>
|0| According to our files, this is the end foryou. Your final journey. We'll deliver your messages. You can depend onus.<|endoftext|>
|0| Thank you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, whatever you think of theTeselecta, we are champions of law and order just as you have alwaysbeen. Is there nothing else we can do?<|endoftext|>
|0| Why would you do this?<|endoftext|>
|0| Of all the things you've told me, this I find hardest tobelieve. Why would you invite your friends to see your death?<|endoftext|>
|1| I had to die. I didn't have to die alone.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy and Rory. The last Centurion and the girl who waited.However dark it got, I'd turn around, and there they'd be.<|endoftext|>
|1| If it's time to go, remember what you'releaving. Remember the best. My friends have always been the best of me.<|endoftext|>
|0| And did you tell them this was going to happen?<|endoftext|>
|1| It would help if you didn't keep asking questions.<|endoftext|>
|1| (sotto) We don't have much time.<|endoftext|>
|0| And this woman you spoke of. Did you invite her?<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello, sweetie.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, she was there. River Song came twice.<|endoftext|>
|1| Napoleon gave me this bottle. Well, I say gave. Threw. Salud!<|endoftext|>
|0| Salud!<|endoftext|>
|0| So, when are we going to 1969?<|endoftext|>
|0| Everything was in place. I only had to do one more thing.I only had to die.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, my God.<|endoftext|>
|1| You all need to stay back. Whatever happens now, you do notinterfere.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's an astronaut. That's an Apollo astronaut in the lake.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, then. Here we are at last.<|endoftext|>
|0| I can't stop it. The suit's in control.<|endoftext|>
|1| You're not supposed to. This has to happen.<|endoftext|>
|0| Run.<|endoftext|>
|1| I did run. Running brought me here.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm trying to fight it, but I can't. It's too strong.<|endoftext|>
|1| I know. It's okay. This is where I die. This is a fixed point.This must happen. This always happens. Don't worry. You won't evenremember this. Look over there.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's me. How can I be there?<|endoftext|>
|1| That's you from the future, serving time for a murder youprobably can't remember. My murder.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why would you do that? Make me watch?<|endoftext|>
|1| So that you know this is inevitable. And you are forgiven.Always and completely forgiven.<|endoftext|>
|0| Please, my love, please, please just run!<|endoftext|>
|1| I can't.<|endoftext|>
|0| Time can be rewritten.<|endoftext|>
|1| Don't you dare. Goodbye, River.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello, Sweetie.<|endoftext|>
|1| What have you done?<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, I think I just drained my weapon systems.<|endoftext|>
|1| But this is fixed. This is a fixed point in time.<|endoftext|>
|0| Fixed points can be rewritten.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, they can't. Of course they can't. Who told you that<|endoftext|>
|0| Well? What happened?<|endoftext|>
|1| Nothing.<|endoftext|>
|0| Nothing?<|endoftext|>
|1| Nothing happened. And then it kept happening. Or, if you'dprefer, everything happened at once, and it won't ever stop. Time isdying. It's going to be five oh two in the afternoon for all eternity.A needle stuck on a record.<|endoftext|>
|0| A record? Good Lord, man, have you never heard of downloads?<|endoftext|>
|1| Said Winston Churchill.<|endoftext|>
|0| Gunsmoke. That's gunsmoke. Oh, I appear to have fired this.<|endoftext|>
|1| We seem to be defending ourselves.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't understand.<|endoftext|>
|1| The creatures that lead the Silence. Remarkable beings. They'rememory-proof.<|endoftext|>
|0| But what does that mean?<|endoftext|>
|1| You can't remember them. The moment you look away, you forgetthey were ever there.<|endoftext|>
|1| Don't panic. In small numbers, they're not too difficult.<|endoftext|>
|0| Go! Go! Go! Keep the Silence in sight at all times, keep youreye drives active.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who the devil are you? Identify yourselves.<|endoftext|>
|0| Pond. Amelia Pond.<|endoftext|>
|1| No! She's on our side. It's okay.<|endoftext|>
|1| No. No, Amy. Amy, why are you wearing that?<|endoftext|>
|0| The Government has again apologised for extensive radiointerference caused by solar flare and sun spot activity.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy?<|endoftext|>
|0| Those stun guns aren't fun. I'm sorry. I wanted to avoid a longconversation. You need to get up, though. We'll be in Cairo shortly.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy Pond. Amelia Pond from Leadworth, please, listen to me. Iknow it seems impossible, but you know me. In another version ofreality you and I were best friends. We, we travelled together. We hadadventures. Amelia Pond, you grew up with a time rift in the wall ofyour bedroom. You can see what others can't. You can remember thingsthat never happened. And if you try, if you really, really try, you'llbe able to<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh.<|endoftext|>
|0| You look rubbish.<|endoftext|>
|1| You look wonderful.<|endoftext|>
|0| So do you. But don't worry, we'll soon fix that.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, Geronimo.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay, you can turn round now. How do I look?<|endoftext|>
|0| Cool.<|endoftext|>
|1| Really?<|endoftext|>
|0| No.<|endoftext|>
|1| Cool office though. Why do you have an office?! Are you aspecial agent boss lady? What's that mean? Not sure about the eyepatch, though.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's not an eye patch. Time's gone wrong. Some of us noticed.There's a whole team of us working on it, you'll see.<|endoftext|>
|1| And you've got an office on a train. That is so cool. Can Ihave an office? Never had an office before. Or a train. Or a trainslash office.<|endoftext|>
|0| God, I've missed you!<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay. Hugging and missing now. Where's the Roman?<|endoftext|>
|0| You mean Rory.<|endoftext|>
|1| Mmm.<|endoftext|>
|0| My husband Rory, yeah?<|endoftext|>
|0| That's him, isn't it? I've no idea. I can't find him, but I lovehim very much, don't I?<|endoftext|>
|1| Apparently.<|endoftext|>
|0| I have to keep doing this, writing and drawing things. It's justit's so hard to keep remembering.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, it's not your fault. Time's gone wrong. Do you rememberwhy?<|endoftext|>
|0| The lakeside.<|endoftext|>
|1| Lake Silencio, Utah. I died.<|endoftext|>
|0| But then you didn't. See, I remember it twice, different ways.<|endoftext|>
|1| Two different versions of the same event, both happening in thesame moment. Time split wide open. Now look at it. All of historyhappening at once.<|endoftext|>
|0| But does it matter? I mean, can't we just stay like this?<|endoftext|>
|1| Time isn't just frozen, it's disintegrating. It will spread andspread and all of reality will simply fall apart.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ma'am? We're about to arrive. Eye drives need to be activated assoon as we disembark.<|endoftext|>
|0| Good point. Thank you, Captain Williams.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hello.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello, sir. Pleased to meet you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Captain Williams, best of the best. Couldn't live without him.<|endoftext|>
|1| No.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is wrong?<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy, you'll find your Rory. You always do. But you have toreally look.<|endoftext|>
|0| I am looking.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, my Amelia Pond. You don't always look hard enough.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why are you older? If time isn't really passing, then how can yoube ageing?<|endoftext|>
|1| Time is still passing for me. Every explosion has an epicentre.I'm it. I'm what's wrong.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's wrong with you?<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm still alive.<|endoftext|>
|0| You have to put it on, sir.<|endoftext|>
|1| An eye patch. What for?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's not an eye patch.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's an eye drive, sir. It communicates directly with the memorycentres of the brain. Acts as external storage.<|endoftext|>
|0| Only thing that works on them. Because no living mind can rememberthese things.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Silence.<|endoftext|>
|0| We've captured over a hundred of them now, all held in thispyramid.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah. I've encountered them before. Always wondered what theylooked like.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, put your eye drive on and you'll retain the information, butonly for as long as you're wearing it.<|endoftext|>
|1| The Silence have human servants. They all wear these.<|endoftext|>
|0| They'd have to.<|endoftext|>
|0| This way.<|endoftext|>
|0| They seem to be noticing you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, they would.<|endoftext|>
|0| So why aren't the human race killing the Silence on sight anymore?<|endoftext|>
|1| That was another reality. What are the tanks for?<|endoftext|>
|0| They can draw electricity from anything. It's how they attack.The fluid insulates them. And I really don't like the way they'relooking at you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Me neither.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ma'am, I'm sure it's nothing, but I should really check this out.They haven't been this active in a while. You two, upstairs. Check allthe tank seals. Then the floors above. Get everyone checking.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sir.<|endoftext|>
|0| You go ahead, Ma'am.<|endoftext|>
|0| Thank you, Captain Williams. Doctor, this way.<|endoftext|>
|1| Captain Williams, nice fellow. What's his first name?<|endoftext|>
|0| Captain. Just through here.<|endoftext|>
|1| Just give us a moment. Just need to check something, Ma'am.<|endoftext|>
|0| We're in. He's on his way.<|endoftext|>
|1| The loyal soldier, waiting to be noticed. Always the pattern.Why is that?<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry, sir?<|endoftext|>
|1| Your boss, you should just ask her out. She likes you. She saidso.<|endoftext|>
|0| Really, sir. What did she say?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, she just sort of generally indicated.<|endoftext|>
|0| What exactly what did she say?<|endoftext|>
|1| She said that you were a Mister Hottie-ness, and that she wouldlike to go out with you for texting and scones.<|endoftext|>
|0| You really haven't done this before, have you?<|endoftext|>
|1| No, I haven't.<|endoftext|>
|0| See you in a moment, sir.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes. Yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Come on, Doctor. Time for you to meet some old friends.<|endoftext|>
|0| Attention all personnel.<|endoftext|>
|0| Attention all personnel. Please checkall assigned containment units.<|endoftext|>
|0| You were right. Just his presence in the building caused the loopto extend by nearly four chronons.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hi, honey. I'm home.<|endoftext|>
|0| And what sort of time do you call this?<|endoftext|>
|0| The death of time. The end of time. The end of us all. Oh,why couldn't you just die?<|endoftext|>
|1| Did my best, dear. I showed up. You just can't get thepsychopaths these days. Love what you've done with the pyramids. Howdid you score all this?<|endoftext|>
|0| Hallucinogenic lipstick. Works wonders on President Kennedy. AndCleopatra was a real pushover.<|endoftext|>
|1| I always thought so.<|endoftext|>
|0| She mentioned you.<|endoftext|>
|1| What did she say?<|endoftext|>
|0| Put down that gun down.<|endoftext|>
|1| Did you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Eventually.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, they're flirting. Do I have to watch this?<|endoftext|>
|0| It was such a basic mistake, wasn't it, Madame Kovarian. Take achild, raise her into a perfect psychopath, introduce her to theDoctor. Who else was I going to fall in love with?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's not funny, River. Reality is fatally compromised. Tell meyou understand that.<|endoftext|>
|0| Dinner?<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't have the time. Nobody has the time, because as long I'malive, time is dying. Because of you, River.<|endoftext|>
|0| Because I refused to kill the man I love.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, you love me, do you? Oh, that's sweet of you. Isn't thatsweet. Come here, you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Get him!<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm not a fool, sweetie. I know what happens if we touch.<|endoftext|>
|0| Get off me. Get him off me! Doctor, no. Let go! Please Doctor,let go!<|endoftext|>
|0| It's moving. Time's moving!<|endoftext|>
|0| Get him off me! Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm sorry, River. It's the only way.<|endoftext|>
|0| Cuff him.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, why do you always have handcuffs? It's the only way. We'rethe opposite poles of the disruption. If we touch, we short out thedifferential. Time can begin again.<|endoftext|>
|0| And I'll be by a lakeside killing you.<|endoftext|>
|1| And time won't fall apart. The clocks will tick. Reality willcontinue. There isn't another way.<|endoftext|>
|0| I didn't say there was, sweetie.<|endoftext|>
|0| There are so many theories about you and I, you know.<|endoftext|>
|1| Idle gossip.<|endoftext|>
|0| Archaeology.<|endoftext|>
|1| Same thing.<|endoftext|>
|0| Am I the woman who marries you, or the woman who murders you?<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't want to marry you.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't want to murder you.<|endoftext|>
|1| This is no fun at all.<|endoftext|>
|0| It isn't, is it?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, what's that?<|endoftext|>
|1| The pyramid above us. How many Silence do you have trappedinside it?<|endoftext|>
|0| None. They're not trapped. They never have been. They've beenwaiting for this, Doctor. For you.<|endoftext|>
|0| They're out! All of them.<|endoftext|>
|0| No one gets in here! Ma'am, my men out there should be able tolock this down. We have them outnumbered.<|endoftext|>
|0| And you're wearing eye drives based on mine, I think. Oops.<|endoftext|>
|1| What do you mean?<|endoftext|>
|0| She's dead.<|endoftext|>
|1| Eye drives off now. Remove them.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Silence would never allow an advantage without taking onethemselves. The effects will vary from person to person. Either deathor debilitating agony. But they will take you all, one by one.<|endoftext|>
|0| What are you doing? No, it's me. Don't be stupid. You needme. Stop it. Stop that!<|endoftext|>
|1| We could stop this right now, you and I.<|endoftext|>
|0| Get it off me.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy, tell her.<|endoftext|>
|0| We've been working on something. Just let us show you.<|endoftext|>
|1| There's no point. There's nothing you can do. My time is up.<|endoftext|>
|0| We're doing this for you!<|endoftext|>
|1| Then people are dying for me. I won't thank you for that,Amelia Pond.<|endoftext|>
|0| Get it<|endoftext|>
|0| Just let us show you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Please. Captain Williams, how long do we have?<|endoftext|>
|0| Er, a couple of minutes.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's enough. We're going to the Receptor Room right at the topof the pyramid. I hope you're ready for a climb.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'll wait down here, Ma'am. Buy you as much time as I can.<|endoftext|>
|0| You have to take your eye drive off.<|endoftext|>
|0| Can't do that, Ma'am. Might forget what's coming.<|endoftext|>
|0| But it could activate any second.<|endoftext|>
|0| It has activated, Ma'am. But I'm of no use to you if I can'tremember. You have to go now, Ma'am.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Now!<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, thank you, Captain Williams.<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory Williams, the man who dies and dies again. Die one lasttime and know she will never come back for you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Come on, you. Up you get. You all right?<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy, help me.<|endoftext|>
|0| You took my baby from me and hurt her. And now she's all grown upand she's fine, but I'll never see my baby again.<|endoftext|>
|0| But you'll still save me, though. Because he would, and you'dnever do anything to disappoint your precious Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ma'am, we have to go, now.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Doctor is very precious to me, you're right. But do you knowwhat else he is, Madame Kovarian? Not here.<|endoftext|>
|0| River Song didn't get it all from you, sweetie.<|endoftext|>
|0| So, you and me, we should get a drink some time.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay.<|endoftext|>
|0| And married.<|endoftext|>
|0| Fine.<|endoftext|>
|1| What's this? Oh, it's as timey-wimey distress beacon. Who builtthis?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm the child of the Tardis. I understand the physics.<|endoftext|>
|1| But that's all you've got, a distress beacon.<|endoftext|>
|0| I've been sending out a message. A distress call. Outside thebubble of our time, the universe is still turning, and I've sent amessage everywhere. To the future and the past, the beginning and theend of everything. The Doctor is dying. Please, please help.<|endoftext|>
|1| River! River, this is ridiculous. That would mean nothing toanyone. It's insane. Worse, it's stupid. You embarrass me.<|endoftext|>
|0| We barricaded the door. We've got a few minutes. Just tell him.Just tell him, River.<|endoftext|>
|0| Those reports of the sun spots and the solar flares. They'rewrong. There aren't any. It's not the sun, it's you. The sky is full ofa million, million voices saying yes, of course we'll help. You'vetouched so many lives, saved so many people. Did you think when yourtime came, you'd really have to do more than just ask? You've decidedthat the universe is better off without you, but the universe doesn'tagree.<|endoftext|>
|1| River, no one can help me. A fixed point has been altered. Timeis disintegrating.<|endoftext|>
|0| I can't let you die.<|endoftext|>
|1| But I have to die.<|endoftext|>
|0| Shut up! I can't let you die without knowing you are loved by somany, and so much, and by no one more than me.<|endoftext|>
|1| River, you and I, we know what this means. We are ground zeroof an explosion that will engulf all reality. Billions on billions willsuffer and die.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'll suffer if I have to kill you.<|endoftext|>
|1| More than every living thing in the universe?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|1| River, River, why do you had have to be this? Melody Pond, yourdaughter. I hope you're both proud.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm not sure I completely understand.<|endoftext|>
|0| We got married and had a kid and that's her.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy, uncuff me now. Okay, I need a strip of cloth about a footlong. Anything will do. Never mind.<|endoftext|>
|1| River, take one end of this. Wrap it around your hand, and holdit out to me.<|endoftext|>
|0| What am I doing?<|endoftext|>
|1| As you're told. Now, we're in the middle of a combat zone, sowe'll have to do the quick version. Captain Williams, say I consent andgladly give.<|endoftext|>
|0| To what?<|endoftext|>
|1| Just say it. Please.<|endoftext|>
|0| I consent and gladly give.<|endoftext|>
|1| Need you to say it too, mother of the bride.<|endoftext|>
|0| I consent and gladly give.<|endoftext|>
|1| Now River, I'm about to whisper something in your ear, and youhave to remember it very, very carefully, and tell no one what I said.<|endoftext|>
|1| I just told you my name. Now, there you go, River Song. MelodyPond. You're the woman who married me. And wife, I have a request. Thisworld is dying and it's my fault, and I can't bear it another day.Please, help me. There isn't another way.<|endoftext|>
|0| Then you may kiss the bride.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'll make it a good one.<|endoftext|>
|0| You'd better.<|endoftext|>
|0| And you are forgiven. Always and completely forgiven.<|endoftext|>
|0| Tick tock goes the clock, he gave all he could give.Tick tock goes the clock, now prison waits for River.)<|endoftext|>
|0| Heard there was a freak meteor shower two miles away, so I got usa bottle.<|endoftext|>
|0| Thank you, dear.<|endoftext|>
|0| So where are we?<|endoftext|>
|0| I just climbed out of the Byzantium. You were there. So young.Didn't have a clue who I was. You're funny like that. Where are you?<|endoftext|>
|0| The Doctor's dead.<|endoftext|>
|0| How are you doing?<|endoftext|>
|0| How do you think?<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, I don't know unless you tell me.<|endoftext|>
|0| I killed someone. Madame Kovarian, in cold blood.<|endoftext|>
|0| In an aborted time line, in a world that never was.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, but I can remember it, so it happened, so I did it. Whatdoes that make me now? I need to talk to the Doctor, but I can't now,can I?<|endoftext|>
|0| If you could talk to him, would it make a difference?<|endoftext|>
|0| But he's dead, so, so I can't.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, Mother, of course he isn't.<|endoftext|>
|0| Not for you, I suppose. You're seeing the younger versions of himrunning around, having adventures.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, I am. But that's not what I mean.<|endoftext|>
|0| Then what do you mean?<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay. I'm going to tell you what I probably shouldn't. TheDoctor's last secret. Don't you want to know what he whispered in myear?<|endoftext|>
|0| He whispered his name.<|endoftext|>
|0| Not his name, no.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, it was. He said it was.<|endoftext|>
|0| Rule One?<|endoftext|>
|0| The Doctor lies.<|endoftext|>
|0| So do I, all the time. Have to. Spoilers. Pretending I don'tknow you're my mother, pretending I don't recognise a space suit inFlorida.<|endoftext|>
|0| What did he whisper in your ear?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, that man. He's always one step ahead of everyone. Always aplan.<|endoftext|>
|0| River, what did he tell you? River.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hey. What?<|endoftext|>
|0| He's not dead. He's not dead.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you sure, River? Are you really, properly sure?<|endoftext|>
|0| Of course I'm sure. I'm his wife.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes! And I'm his (pause) mother in law.<|endoftext|>
|0| Father dear, I think Mummy might need another drink.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes. Yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who's carrying me? I demand to know. I'm a head, I haverights. I want my doors open this time. I demand that my doors areopen.<|endoftext|>
|0| Is it you? It is, isn't it. It is you, I can sense it. But howdid you do it? How could you possibly have escaped?<|endoftext|>
|0| Is there nothing else we can do?<|endoftext|>
|1| Actually, thinking about it<|endoftext|>
|1| Look into my eye.<|endoftext|>
|1| The Teselecta. A Doctor in a Doctor suit. Time said I had to beon that beach, so I dressed for the occasion. Barely got singed in thatboat.<|endoftext|>
|0| So you're going to do this? Let them all think you're dead?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's the only way, then they can all forget me. I got too big,Dorium. Too noisy. Time to step back into the shadows.<|endoftext|>
|0| And Doctor Song, in prison all her days?<|endoftext|>
|1| Her days, yes. Her nights? Well, that's between her and me, eh?<|endoftext|>
|0| So many secrets, Doctor. I'll help you keep them, of course.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, you're not exactly going anywhere, are you?<|endoftext|>
|0| But you're a fool nonetheless. It's all still waiting for you.The fields of Trenzalore, the fall of the Eleventh, and the question.<|endoftext|>
|1| Goodbye, Dorium.<|endoftext|>
|0| The first question. The question that must never be answered,hidden in plain sight. The question you've been running from all yourlife. Doctor who? Doctor who? Doctor Who. <|endoftext|>
|0| Amy. Amy? Hello? Amy, it's me, the Doctor. Hello. Bit of asituation.<|endoftext|>
|0| Intruder alert.<|endoftext|>
|1| I've got my finger on a button, which is fine, but as soon as Itake my finger off the button the spaceship is going to explode.(Sparks.)<|endoftext|>
|1| Argh. Which is good in one way, because the spaceship inquestion is about to attack the Earth, but bad in another way, becauseI'm on the spaceship and I'm going to get all smithereened. Now, plan.I'm going to send you the coordinates so you can fly the Tardis hereand rescue me. Only three flaws in this plan as far as I can see. One,I don't have the coordinates. Two, you can't fly the Tardis. Three, ohdear, you're not even there. You left ages ago. Oh, well. I think Ijust wanted a chat before all the smithereens. Merry Christmas, Amelia.<|endoftext|>
|0| People of Earth, you stand alone.<|endoftext|>
|0| Intruder alert. Intruder alert.<|endoftext|>
|0| Intruder alert.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah! Come here, spacesuit. Come to Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| Got it!<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello? Hello? Hello, are you all right?<|endoftext|>
|1| Ow.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you hurt? Did you fall? Where did you fall from?<|endoftext|>
|1| Helmet.<|endoftext|>
|0| All right, just just let me. I don't want to hurt you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh.<|endoftext|>
|1| I can't see. I'm blind!<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh no, love, no. I think you've just got your helmet onbackwards. How did you manage that?<|endoftext|>
|1| I got dressed in a hurry.<|endoftext|>
|0| Cyril, what are you doing awake?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's the moon's fault, apparently. It's too interesting.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's astronomy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't make up words. He's always making up things and breathing.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where's your father?<|endoftext|>
|0| In the garden.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's he doing in the garden?<|endoftext|>
|0| Agriculture.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're not fooling anyone.<|endoftext|>
|0| Listen, Cyril. Tell him that I've borrowed Mister Goldsmith'scar. That I found a spaceman in a field, possibly an angel, but he'sinjured and I can't get his helmet off, so I'm having to take him intotown to find a police telephone box, all right?<|endoftext|>
|0| All right.<|endoftext|>
|0| Good boy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Was that your mother? Where's she going?<|endoftext|>
|0| Out.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ow! Did we just bump into something?<|endoftext|>
|0| No, no.<|endoftext|>
|1| We seemed to bump into quite a lot of things.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, a lot of things get in the way. It's hardly my fault. Youneed to take that silly thing off.<|endoftext|>
|1| Can't. Impact suit. It's still repairing me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Repairing you?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, well, you know, that's the idea.<|endoftext|>
|0| Won't it repair you all back to front?<|endoftext|>
|1| No. No.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, that's good. Oh, that's a street lamp.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, I got that impression.<|endoftext|>
|0| Round this way. Don't you want me to take you to hospital orsomething? You're welcome to come to our house.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, no, no. I'm fine. I just need to find the, er, the key.<|endoftext|>
|0| Do you want me to do it with a pin? I'm good with a pin.<|endoftext|>
|1| Multi-dimensional, triple encoded temporal interface. Notreally susceptible to pointy things.<|endoftext|>
|0| Got it.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay. Suddenly the last nine hundred years of time travel seemthat bit less secure. Thank you for taking care of me. You didn't haveto, you know. You've been very kind.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, don't be silly. It's Christmas Eve. No one should be aloneat Christmas.<|endoftext|>
|1| What did you say your name was?<|endoftext|>
|0| Madge. Madge Arwell.<|endoftext|>
|1| If thre's anything that I can do for you, let me know.<|endoftext|>
|0| How?<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't know. Make a wish. That usually works.<|endoftext|>
|0| Does it?<|endoftext|>
|1| It did for me. You're here, aren't you? Well, don't wait aroundhere. Just off you go home. I'll just go and, and wait inside here.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ow! Wrong one. Do you think we could try again?<|endoftext|>
|0| You were a long time. Been taking home strays as usual?<|endoftext|>
|0| Just the one. What have you been reading? Not the war again.People keep reading about the war, then it will actually happen. Andthen where will you be?<|endoftext|>
|0| Sir, Anderson's in a bad way. Where are we?<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't know. Somewhere over the Channel.<|endoftext|>
|0| What do I tell Anderson?<|endoftext|>
|0| Tell him, tell him, tell him we're going home for Christmas.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, sir.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm sorry, my love.<|endoftext|>
|0| When's Father coming back?<|endoftext|>
|0| For Christmas, like he always does. Now, hurry up and think ofsomething.<|endoftext|>
|0| But we're going to Uncle Digby's house. Will he be there?<|endoftext|>
|0| He will, won't he, mother? Daddy will be there.<|endoftext|>
|0| Of course he will.<|endoftext|>
|0| See? Now, have you thought of anything?<|endoftext|>
|0| Er, yep.<|endoftext|>
|0| Count of three, then. Make a wish. One, two, three!<|endoftext|>
|0| Is it haunted?<|endoftext|>
|0| Is it draughty?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, this is no good. Where's Mister Cardew? He was supposed tobe here.<|endoftext|>
|0| Maybe it's haunted by the ghost of Uncle Digby.<|endoftext|>
|0| Uncle Digby is still alive. He's in a home in Battersea.<|endoftext|>
|0| Mister Cardew!<|endoftext|>
|0| But why do we have to come here?<|endoftext|>
|0| Because of the bombing, stupid.<|endoftext|>
|0| I like the bombing. It's exciting.<|endoftext|>
|0| Will Father be here? Well, he will, won't he? You said he'd meetus at the house.<|endoftext|>
|0| He'll be here. Of course he will. You don't need to keep askingabout it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Father!<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry, it's the door. It's developed a fault.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, hello? Mister Cardew?<|endoftext|>
|1| There we go. Well, come in. In you come.<|endoftext|>
|1| Mind your step. Now, don't worry. The back door is still,broadly speaking, operational.<|endoftext|>
|1| Right then, may I take your cases?<|endoftext|>
|0| Thank you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Thank you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Thank you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Lovely. Would you mind carrying them for me? I need to show youround.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who are you?<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm the caretaker.<|endoftext|>
|0| But you're not Mister Cardew.<|endoftext|>
|1| I agree.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't understand. Are you the new caretaker?<|endoftext|>
|1| Usually called the Doctor. Or the Caretaker or Get Off ThisPlanet. Though, strictly speaking, that probably isn't a name. Hello,Madge Arwell.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello.<|endoftext|>
|1| And Cyril Arwell. And Lily Arwell. Now, come on, come on. Lotsto see. Whistle stop tour. Take notes, there will be questions.<|endoftext|>
|1| Smaller sitting room. Just chairs. Bitpointless without a television, so I made some repairs.<|endoftext|>
|1| I know.<|endoftext|>
|1| Kitchen! That's a cooker, probably. Andthese are taps. Hot, cold, lemonade.<|endoftext|>
|0| Lemonade?<|endoftext|>
|1| I know!<|endoftext|>
|1| Staircase. It seems to have broken down.We'll have to walk up.<|endoftext|>
|1| I sleep up there. Stay away. Beware ofpanthers.<|endoftext|>
|0| Panthers?<|endoftext|>
|1| They're terrifying. Have you never seen panthers? Cyril!<|endoftext|>
|1| Mum's bedroom. Grown up. Your basic boring.<|endoftext|>
|1| Lily and Cyril's room. I'm going to be honest, masterpiece. Theultimate bedroom. A sciencey wiencey workbench. A jungle. A maze. Awindow disguised as a mirror. A mirror disguised as a window. Selectionof torches for midnight feasts and secret reading. Zen garden,mysterious cupboard, zone of tranquillity, rubber wall, dream tank,exact model of the rest of the house, not quite to scale. Apologies.Dolls with comical expressions, the Magna Carta, a foot spa, Cluedo, ayellow fort.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where are the beds?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, I couldn't fit everything in. There had to be sacrifices.Anyway, who needs beds when you've got<|endoftext|>
|1| Hammocks! I know.<|endoftext|>
|0| But how do you get on?<|endoftext|>
|1| Watch and learn, kid.<|endoftext|>
|0| For God's sake!<|endoftext|>
|1| This hammock has developed a fault.<|endoftext|>
|0| Can you please stop talking? Can you please just stop!<|endoftext|>
|1| Sorry.<|endoftext|>
|0| Children, go downstairs.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why?<|endoftext|>
|0| Are we leaving?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes. No. I don't know. Just please go downstairs!<|endoftext|>
|0| You don't need to shout.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why are you doing all this?<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm just trying to take care of things. I'm the caretaker.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's not what caretakers do.<|endoftext|>
|1| Then why are they called caretakers?<|endoftext|>
|0| Their father's dead.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm sorry.<|endoftext|>
|0| Lily and Cyril's father, my husband, is dead and they don't knowyet, because if I tell them now, then Christmas will always be whattook their father away from them, and no one should have to live likethat. Of course, when the Christmas period is over, I shall. I don'tknow why I keep shouting at them.<|endoftext|>
|1| Because very time you see them happy, you remember how sadthey're going to be, and it breaks your heart.<|endoftext|>
|0| Mother, come and see!<|endoftext|>
|0| Mother! You've got to see this!<|endoftext|>
|1| Because what's the point in them being happy now if they'regoing to be sad later.<|endoftext|>
|0| Mother.<|endoftext|>
|0| Mother, are you coming?<|endoftext|>
|1| The answer is, of course, because they are going to be sadlater. Now, we'd better get downstairs. I think they may have found themain sitting room.<|endoftext|>
|0| Mother!<|endoftext|>
|1| I repaired it.<|endoftext|>
|1| I know.<|endoftext|>
|0| Look at that present. It's for me.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, it says it's for all of us.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm the youngest. I get to open it first.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doesn't say who it's from. Mother, who left this here?<|endoftext|>
|0| That man is quite ridiculous. You must stay away from him.<|endoftext|>
|0| I like him.<|endoftext|>
|0| I like him, too.<|endoftext|>
|0| And it's a nice tree, isn't it.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's the best tree in the world.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes. Yes, I suppose it is.<|endoftext|>
|0| Say it, Mother. Go on, please. Say the thing you always say.<|endoftext|>
|0| This Christmas is going to be the best Christmas ever.<|endoftext|>
|0| Lily? Lily, can you sleep? Lily!<|endoftext|>
|0| Shut up.<|endoftext|>
|0| What do you think that present is? We could just sneak down andhave a look.<|endoftext|>
|0| Go to sleep.<|endoftext|>
|0| You were lying about the panthers.<|endoftext|>
|1| Famous last words.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why have you got a phone box in your room?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's not a phone box, it's my wardrobe. I've just painted it tolook like a phone box.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, what are you doing?<|endoftext|>
|1| Rewiring.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why would you rewire a wardrobe?<|endoftext|>
|1| Have you seen the way I dress?<|endoftext|>
|0| Who are you? Really, who are you?<|endoftext|>
|1| Your brother, where is he?<|endoftext|>
|0| Still in bed, asleep.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay. Faulty, then.<|endoftext|>
|1| You're sure he's still in bed?<|endoftext|>
|0| See?<|endoftext|>
|1| Shush.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, he's good. The old bear and duvet, eh? Classic.<|endoftext|>
|1| Cyril!<|endoftext|>
|0| What's happening? I don't<|endoftext|>
|0| What is that?<|endoftext|>
|1| With me. Quickly, come on.<|endoftext|>
|1| That's it. In you come. Brr, bit cold. Never mind. Cyril!Cyril!<|endoftext|>
|0| Where are we?<|endoftext|>
|1| In a forest, in a box, in a sitting room. Pay attention. He'sabout twenty minutes ahead.<|endoftext|>
|0| But we just saw him.<|endoftext|>
|1| Time moves differently across the dimensional planes. What dothey teach you in schools these days?<|endoftext|>
|0| But I don't understand where we are.<|endoftext|>
|1| We've gone through a dimensional portal thingy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, what's that supposed to be? Where did it come from?<|endoftext|>
|1| It was a present, and it wasn't supposed to be opened tillChristmas Day. Honestly, who opens their Christmas presents early?Okay. Shut up. Everyone.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't understand. Is this place real, or is it fairyland?<|endoftext|>
|1| Fairyland? Oh, grow up, Lily. Fairyland looks completelydifferent. Now, these are Cyril's footprints, and these are the ones hewas following. Notice anything?<|endoftext|>
|0| The other footprints are getting bigger.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes. Whatever your brother's following, it's growing.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, we have to get after him.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's okay, you're fine. Don't worry.<|endoftext|>
|0| Is that tree alive?<|endoftext|>
|1| Of course it's alive. It's a tree.<|endoftext|>
|0| But is it dangerous?<|endoftext|>
|1| Every rose has its thorns.<|endoftext|>
|0| They're like Christmas tree decorations.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah. Naturally occurring Christmas trees. How cool is that?<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't understand.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's a big universe. Everything happens somewhere. Call it acoincidence. Call it an idea echoing among the stars. Personally, Icall it a brilliant idea for a Christmas trip. Or it should've been. Doyou know the difference between wind and trees talking to each other?<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|1| No wind. I've been here many times, but I've never heard thetrees so active. Something's wrong. What are you doing? What are you upto?<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm sorry, Lily, I really am, but there is something very wrongin this forest, and your brother's right in the middle of it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Lily and Cyril Arwell, where are you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Why would you bring us to this place?<|endoftext|>
|1| It was supposed to be a treat. This is one of the safestplanets I know. There's never anything dangerous here.<|endoftext|>
|1| There are sentences I should just keep away from.<|endoftext|>
|0| This tree farm is private property. You are trespassing.<|endoftext|>
|0| Unarmed, sir.<|endoftext|>
|0| What the hell are you doing here?<|endoftext|>
|0| No, wait, armed! No, unarmed. Sorry, sir. She's wearing wool,sir. The natural fabrics, they interfere with the<|endoftext|>
|0| Please say we can tell the difference between wool and sidearms.<|endoftext|>
|0| We can tell the difference, sir.<|endoftext|>
|0| Can we?<|endoftext|>
|0| Not always, sir, no.<|endoftext|>
|0| What are you doing here? Do you understand what is about tohappen in this forest?<|endoftext|>
|0| I was just<|endoftext|>
|0| Sir, I think she's a time traveller.<|endoftext|>
|0| We're sure it's not her cardigan?<|endoftext|>
|0| Who are you? It was Christmas.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's just irresponsible. How can you do this to my brother?<|endoftext|>
|1| It was meant to be a supervised trip.<|endoftext|>
|0| To the future?<|endoftext|>
|1| Future, yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| The future on a different planet.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh yes, very different.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where Christmas trees happen.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, sort of Christmas trees. They're not really Christmastrees.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, look at that!<|endoftext|>
|0| What, are we going in?<|endoftext|>
|1| Cyril did.<|endoftext|>
|1| Interesting.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's that? Is that a statue? What is it? It's like a King.<|endoftext|>
|1| A King, possibly, but not a statue. Look at the floor. This iswhat Cyril was following. The growing thing. Hatched from a bauble on atree. Grew to this size in less than an hour, I'd say. Impressive. Andso is this building. Yes. It's grown, see. This building, it isn't abuilding. It's a group of trees grown in the shape of a building.Disguised as a building. Ooo, clever. I love. Clever, clever oldforest. So, a forest grows a building. Why would it do that, Lily?<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't know.<|endoftext|>
|1| Why is there honey in a honey trap?<|endoftext|>
|0| Because it's a trap?<|endoftext|>
|1| Exactly. Thing about people, we can never resist a door.<|endoftext|>
|0| So this is a trap. What, we've just walked straight into a trap?<|endoftext|>
|1| A people trap. Question is, why does a forest need people?<|endoftext|>
|0| We should go. We have to get out of here.<|endoftext|>
|1| Except?<|endoftext|>
|0| Except Cyril was here.<|endoftext|>
|1| So let's find Cyril.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ma'am, please stop crying. I can'tinterrogate you while you're crying. This is a military engagement!There's no crying in military engagements. Corporal Ven Garr, are you<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm fine, sir.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is wrong with you?<|endoftext|>
|0| I have mother issues, sir. It's all on file. It won't affectthe performance of my duties.<|endoftext|>
|0| Er, sir. Er, with regret, I'm going to have to lower my gun.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why?<|endoftext|>
|0| She is a crying, unarmed female civilian. I'm thinking of thevisual.<|endoftext|>
|0| Nobody's looking.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doesn't mean there's no visual.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's exactly what nobody's looking means. It means there's novisual.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm sorry, sir. It's under control. Do you want me to shoother, sir?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, this visual's deteriorating, sir.<|endoftext|>
|0| Shut up.<|endoftext|>
|0| What are you doing?<|endoftext|>
|0| I am respecting her as a woman, sir.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, we're putting our guns on the ground. Okay? Happy now?We're stepping away from our guns. Now can we interrogate you? We'refrom Androzani Major. The year is 5345, and we mean you no harm. Whereare you from?<|endoftext|>
|0| England, 1941. And there's a war on.<|endoftext|>
|0| Crying's ever so useful, isn't it?<|endoftext|>
|0| If you say so. But there's nothing you could say that wouldconvince me you'd ever use that gun.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh really? Well, I'm looking for my children.<|endoftext|>
|1| Cyril?<|endoftext|>
|0| Cyril, can you hear me?<|endoftext|>
|0| Cyril? Cyril, can you hear me?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, of course. It's wood. It's rubbish atwood.<|endoftext|>
|0| It doesn't look like wood.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's disguised wood. Have you been listening?<|endoftext|>
|0| How can trees grow into a building?<|endoftext|>
|1| Never underestimate a tree, Lily. I met the Forest of Cheemonce. She fancied me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Look at that.<|endoftext|>
|1| Busy, actually. Yes, I know, it's wood. Get over it.<|endoftext|>
|0| But there are stars. There are stars coming out.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, that does happen, Lily. Cyril!<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, but out of the trees. What is that?<|endoftext|>
|1| Life force. Pure life force, just singing.<|endoftext|>
|0| Beautiful. Doesn't it make you want to cry?<|endoftext|>
|1| Crying when you're happy. Good for you. That's so human.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's that? What is it? Tell me what?<|endoftext|>
|1| Cyril, can you hear me?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh my god. Oh my god.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is all this? Is it some kind of cockpit? My husband's apilot.<|endoftext|>
|0| It drives the platform.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't understand! How did I get here?<|endoftext|>
|0| You tell us, ma'am.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm looking for my children.<|endoftext|>
|0| There is nobody else in this forest. There can't be.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, she found her way in. Maybe her kids did, too.<|endoftext|>
|0| Then God help them.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why do you say that?<|endoftext|>
|0| We can do a scan for life forms. We can detect people, eventhough they're far away.<|endoftext|>
|0| Like RDF, Radar.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah.<|endoftext|>
|0| Then please stop patronising me and get on with it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, ma'am.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why did you say God help my children?<|endoftext|>
|0| This forest is about to be harvested.<|endoftext|>
|0| Harvested?<|endoftext|>
|0| Androzani trees. Greatest fuel source ever. The entire area isbeing melted down for battery fluid.<|endoftext|>
|0| Melted down? How do you melt a forest?<|endoftext|>
|0| Acid rain. The satellites are in position. Anyone still outthere in five minutes is going to burn.<|endoftext|>
|0| Caretaker, it's coming. Open it!<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm trying!<|endoftext|>
|0| Open it!<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm trying.<|endoftext|>
|1| That wasn't me.<|endoftext|>
|0| It doesn't matter.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's wrong with him, Caretaker? Is he dead?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's okay. He's just unconscious. So what are you? Not a King,a Queen! TheQueen Bee of the forest.<|endoftext|>
|0| Caretaker, look.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's like<|endoftext|>
|0| Like what?<|endoftext|>
|1| Like the life force is leaving the forest.<|endoftext|>
|0| What are they doing? Stop him!<|endoftext|>
|1| Annoying aliens made of wood! It was always going to happen,you know. Er, it's okay. I think they just want to talk to us.<|endoftext|>
|0| They're scared. Can't you hear them? The trees are screaming.Can't you hear?<|endoftext|>
|1| No, but you can. You're connected to them.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, picking up life signs about half amile away.<|endoftext|>
|0| Can we go to them? Can we move this thing?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm not trained, ma'am. Those two are.<|endoftext|>
|0| I can't trust them.<|endoftext|>
|0| I can't drive the platform, ma'am.<|endoftext|>
|0| It looks a little like a plane. My husband flies a plane. Hetook me up once.<|endoftext|>
|0| It takes years of training. Scanning for an audio connection.We might be able to hear them.<|endoftext|>
|0| Acid rain alert. Five minute warning. Prepare for beam out.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm so sorry. You have to find a way out.<|endoftext|>
|0| Evacuate.<|endoftext|>
|0| Acid fall is coming. You won't last two minutes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Evacuate.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, no, please wait. No, what am I to do?<|endoftext|>
|0| Evacuate.<|endoftext|>
|0| Evacuate.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where have you gone?<|endoftext|>
|0| Acid fall in five minutes. Unauthorised personnel will beincinerated.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why have the stars left the trees?<|endoftext|>
|0| I think they're<|endoftext|>
|0| Just concentrate. What are they<|endoftext|>
|1| Doing?<|endoftext|>
|0| Evacuating. They're evacuating.<|endoftext|>
|1| Why?<|endoftext|>
|0| They're frightened of the rain. The rain that burns.<|endoftext|>
|0| Caretaker, please explain. I'mfrightened.<|endoftext|>
|0| Those stars.<|endoftext|>
|1| They're pure life force. Souls, if youlike. And they're trying to escape because they think their home isgoing to burn.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why can't they just float up into the sky?<|endoftext|>
|1| They need to travel inside a living thing. Inside Cyril. Yousee, this, it's not a crown, it's a relay. They're turning your brotherinto a lifeboat. That's what this place is for, then. It's an escapeplan, is that it? Don't you harm him. Do not touch that child!<|endoftext|>
|0| Your coming was foretold.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh my God, what is that? Why did he sound like that?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, hello. Are we lip synching now?<|endoftext|>
|0| We had faith. Your coming was foretold.<|endoftext|>
|1| There's no such thing as foretelling. Trust a time traveller.<|endoftext|>
|0| We waited, and you came.<|endoftext|>
|1| So, you've got an escape plan. Why aren't you escaping?<|endoftext|>
|0| The child is weak.<|endoftext|>
|1| You mean he's a child.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, he is weak. The forest cannot live in him. But thereare others.<|endoftext|>
|1| There certainly are. And, the good thing is I look great in ahat. So, let's get this thing off, eh?<|endoftext|>
|0| You are also weak.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm really not. Let's save a forest, eh, Cyril?<|endoftext|>
|0| You are not the one. You are weak.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm really not.<|endoftext|>
|1| Argh!<|endoftext|>
|0| Let go! Just let go! Drop it! Let it go! Please, just drop it.<|endoftext|>
|1| I can't!<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, it's funny, isn't it. It's sort of tingly.<|endoftext|>
|1| Tingly?<|endoftext|>
|0| She is strong, but she is young.<|endoftext|>
|1| She's strong, I'm weak. Interesting.<|endoftext|>
|0| Mummy?<|endoftext|>
|0| Cyril, it's all right. It's me. Mummy isn't here but, we're goinghome to her right now, aren't we, Caretaker?<|endoftext|>
|1| No. I don't think we are. The rain that burns. Acid rain.<|endoftext|>
|0| We have to get out of this forest.We're in terrible danger. This tower won't protect us for long.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where's Mummy?<|endoftext|>
|0| She's coming. You know she's coming, because<|endoftext|>
|0| Because she always comes, doesn't she.<|endoftext|>
|1| Cyril. The way we came here. That door won't stay open forever. Now, I'm not even sure if I can get us through the forest safely,but if we're going to have any chance at all, we have to go now.<|endoftext|>
|0| No. We wait for Mummy. Mummy always comes.<|endoftext|>
|1| Not this time, Cyril. I'm sorry, but not this time.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's that?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's an Androzani Harvester, but<|endoftext|>
|0| You recognise that thing?<|endoftext|>
|1| More to the point, I think I recognise the driving. Ha ha!Madge has entered the forest!<|endoftext|>
|0| Come on, Madge.<|endoftext|>
|1| You can do it. You go, girl.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, shut up, you ridiculous oaf!<|endoftext|>
|0| Come on. This way, girl. You can do it, you can do it!Excellent driving! Hello!<|endoftext|>
|0| Caretaker?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes?<|endoftext|>
|0| You're fired!<|endoftext|>
|1| It's okay, she's fine. Don't worry. Stay here. Just stay here.<|endoftext|>
|1| Madge! Madge!<|endoftext|>
|1| You okay?<|endoftext|>
|0| Stay inside. The rain is frightful. Lily? Cyril?<|endoftext|>
|0| Cyril.<|endoftext|>
|0| Mum!<|endoftext|>
|0| Lily. Oh, what are you doing? How dare you leave the house?Cyril, what have I told you about opening your presents early?<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry, mummy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Something like this was bound to happen. What are those?<|endoftext|>
|0| Stay away from it. You have to stay back.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's beautiful, isn't it?<|endoftext|>
|0| Mummy?<|endoftext|>
|0| See how it shines.<|endoftext|>
|1| Nice one, Madge. A complete write off.<|endoftext|>
|0| The stars are going inside her. She's takingthe whole forest.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, this is marvellous. Oh, this is really quite wonderful.<|endoftext|>
|1| Madge? Are you all right? Talk to me. Madge, can you hear me?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, I can hear you. I'm perfectly fine, thank you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Fine? You've got a whole world inside your head.<|endoftext|>
|0| I know! It's funny, isn't it? One can't imagine being a forest,then suddenly one can. How remarkable.<|endoftext|>
|1| You're okay. She's okay.<|endoftext|>
|0| She is strong.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ooo. That wasn't me. This is all really rather clever, isn't it?<|endoftext|>
|1| She's strong. She's strong. Ooo, stupid me. Stupid old Doctor.Do you get it, Cyril?<|endoftext|>
|0| No.<|endoftext|>
|1| Lily, you do, don't you?<|endoftext|>
|0| No.<|endoftext|>
|1| Course you do. Think about it. Weak and strong. It's atranslation. Translated from the base code of nature itself. You and I,Cyril, we're weak. But she's female. More than female, she's mum. Howelse does life ever travel? The Mother ship.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's happening?<|endoftext|>
|1| No idea. Do what I do. Hold tight and pretend it's a plan.<|endoftext|>
|1| This is amazing.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where are we?<|endoftext|>
|1| Technically, we're not anywhere. We've flown into the TimeVortex. You've what you wanted. Those idiots down there can burn yourold home and you'll be safe out here. But these people helped you, andthey're in my protection. Now help them. How do we get home?<|endoftext|>
|0| Think.<|endoftext|>
|1| Sorry? What?<|endoftext|>
|0| She must only think.<|endoftext|>
|1| Madge, did you hear that? You said it, but did you hear it?You've got to think.<|endoftext|>
|0| Think what?<|endoftext|>
|1| Think of home. Just picture it, feel it! You have to reallyfeel it. Can you do that? Your mind is controlling this vessel. You canfly us all back for Christmas.<|endoftext|>
|0| My head is full of trees, Caretaker. Can't you fly us home?<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't have a home to think of. And between you and me, I'molder than I look and I can't feel the way you do. Not any more. Andyou really need to feel it, Madge. Everything about home that you missuntil you can't bear it. Until you almost burst.<|endoftext|>
|0| Till it hurts. Is that what you mean, Caretaker? Till it hurts.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes. Yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well then, home in time for Christmas!<|endoftext|>
|0| What's happening? Where are we going?<|endoftext|>
|1| Show them! Show them! Ha! The Time Vortex. Your mother isflying a forest through the Time Vortex. Be a little impressed. Whatare you going home for? What's pulling you there? Please, try. Please,think.<|endoftext|>
|0| Reg!<|endoftext|>
|0| Daddy!<|endoftext|>
|0| My Reg!<|endoftext|>
|1| That's it, focus on Reg. Be careful, but focus on him.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, I don't know.<|endoftext|>
|1| How did you meet? You and Reg. Tell me how you met.<|endoftext|>
|0| He followed me home. I worked in the dairy. He always used tofollow me home.<|endoftext|>
|0| Look at Father. He looks so young.<|endoftext|>
|0| He said he'd keep on following me till I married him. Didn'tlike to make a scene.<|endoftext|>
|1| Just stay focused. Think of home. This thing, it workspsychically. It'll find a signal and lock on.<|endoftext|>
|0| No. No, please. Don't show me that. Please don't show me that!<|endoftext|>
|0| Is that Daddy's plane?<|endoftext|>
|0| Please, I don't want to see that! Please!<|endoftext|>
|1| No, no, no, no, no, Madge. Don't break the signal now. We can'tbreak it now. I'm sorry, Madge.<|endoftext|>
|0| Not the night he died. I don't want to see him die!<|endoftext|>
|0| What do you mean, the night he died?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh please don't make me watch him die!<|endoftext|>
|0| Mummy? Is Daddy dead? Mummy!<|endoftext|>
|0| Sir, Anderson's in a bad way. Where arewe?<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't know. Somewhere over the Channel.<|endoftext|>
|0| What do I tell Anderson?<|endoftext|>
|0| Tell him. Tell him, tell him we're going home for Christmas.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, sir.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm sorry, my love.<|endoftext|>
|0| Goodbye, my love. Goodbye!<|endoftext|>
|1| Cyril, Lily, are you all right?<|endoftext|>
|0| Are they dead?<|endoftext|>
|1| No, they're just wood now. They've been emptied. The forest hasgone from your head too, hasn't it.<|endoftext|>
|0| But where is it now?<|endoftext|>
|1| The life force of the whole forest has transmuted itself into asub-etheric waveband of light, which can exist as a<|endoftext|>
|1| The souls of the trees are out among the stars, and they'reshining, very happy. And you got them there. Well done, Madge.<|endoftext|>
|0| And where are we?<|endoftext|>
|1| Home! Christmas morning.<|endoftext|>
|1| We've taken a bit of a short cut. Haven't you always wanted todo that?<|endoftext|>
|0| Mother?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, look at you. You've been so brave, you. Look, we're homeagain, see?<|endoftext|>
|0| What did you mean, watch him die? Where's Father? Where is he?Where's Daddy? Why are you holding a telegram? Well, what does it say?<|endoftext|>
|0| Please, just tell us.<|endoftext|>
|0| Tell us!<|endoftext|>
|1| I imagine you'd prefer to be alone.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't believe anyone would prefer that. Stay close, Caretaker.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'll be right outside.<|endoftext|>
|0| Lily, Cyril.<|endoftext|>
|0| A few nights ago, your father, who asyou know, was the best of men and the bravest of pilots<|endoftext|>
|0| Was flying home for Christmas. His plane wasbadly damaged, and his instruments failed him. Unfortunately, he wasflying on a night where there was no moon, and because it was verycloudy, there were no stars to. There were no stars to light his way.<|endoftext|>
|0| Did he get lost?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, Cyril. He got so very lost.<|endoftext|>
|1| Er, sorry to interrupt. You might want to pop out here for amoment.<|endoftext|>
|0| Caretaker, I'm talking to my children.<|endoftext|>
|1| I know, and before you go any further, I think you'd bettercome and look.<|endoftext|>
|1| No stars to light the way, Madge? There was one.<|endoftext|>
|0| There was you.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is it?<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't know, but it's all we've got. We can follow it.<|endoftext|>
|1| Madge Arwell, who flew a whole forestthough the Time Vortex, plus one husband.<|endoftext|>
|1| He did it again, Madge. He followed you home. Look what you cando, Mother Christmas.<|endoftext|>
|0| Madge, what am I doing here?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's Christmas Day, my love! Where else would you be?<|endoftext|>
|0| Christmas Day? How?<|endoftext|>
|0| We took a short cut.<|endoftext|>
|0| Daddy!<|endoftext|>
|1| Happy crying. Humany wumany.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah.<|endoftext|>
|0| Of course. It's you, isn't it? My spaceman angel, with his headon backwards.<|endoftext|>
|1| How do I look the right way round?<|endoftext|>
|0| Funnier.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay.<|endoftext|>
|0| So you came back.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, you were there for me when I had a bad day. Always liketo return a favour. Got a bit glitchy in the middle there, but it sortof worked out in the end. Story of my life.<|endoftext|>
|0| Thank you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, you did it all yourself, Madge Arwell. But thanks forthanking me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Now, the last time I saw you, I went back the next day, but thepolice box had gone.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah. You want to see how it's done?<|endoftext|>
|0| No. I want you to stay for Christmas, please.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah, well, you see, things to do, people to see.<|endoftext|>
|0| Of course. Yes. Family of your own.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, no, actually.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh. Yes, yes, you said no family. But there must be people wholove you. Friends.<|endoftext|>
|1| No. Well, yes, but. It's a long story. But they all think I'mdead. Never mind. Anyway, watch my box do its thing. It's really cool.You'll love it.<|endoftext|>
|0| No. No one should be alone at Christmas.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm fine. I don't mind. I'm really very good at being<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm not talking about you, I'm talking about your friends. Youcan't let them think that you're dead. Not at Christmas.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's complicated. Very complicated. It's far too complicated toexplain right now.<|endoftext|>
|0| You must tell them. At once. Off you go.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, Mum. I'll think about it.<|endoftext|>
|1| Now, eyes on the box.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, Caretaker? What if I require you again?<|endoftext|>
|1| Make a wish.<|endoftext|>
|0| What the hell was that?<|endoftext|>
|0| That was just the Caretaker returning to the Time Vortex. It's alovely place. I've been there myself. Shall we go downstairs?<|endoftext|>
|0| Argh! If that is more carol singers, I have a water pistol!You don't want to be all wet on a night like this.<|endoftext|>
|1| Not absolutely sure how long<|endoftext|>
|0| Two years?<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay. Fair point.<|endoftext|>
|0| So, you're not dead.<|endoftext|>
|1| And a happy New Year!<|endoftext|>
|0| River told us.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, of course she did.<|endoftext|>
|0| She's a good girl. Well? I'm not going to hug first.<|endoftext|>
|1| Nor am I.<|endoftext|>
|0| Mister Pond! Guess who's coming for dinner?<|endoftext|>
|0| Whoa. Not dead, then.<|endoftext|>
|0| We've done that.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh.<|endoftext|>
|0| We're about to have Christmas dinner. Joining us?<|endoftext|>
|1| If it's no trouble.<|endoftext|>
|0| There's a place set for you.<|endoftext|>
|1| But you didn't know I was coming. Why would you set me a place?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, because we always do. It's Christmas, you moron.<|endoftext|>
|0| Come on.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello, Ponds. Checking in. How are you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Not much to report. Surfed the fire falls of FlorinallNine. Not deliberately, just the easiest way out.<|endoftext|>
|0| Met Mata Hari in a Paris hotel room.<|endoftext|>
|0| What an interesting woman.<|endoftext|>
|0| Laid down some backing vocals.<|endoftext|>
|1| I should be with you any day now. Literally any day. Helmicregulator's playing up. Can't get the temporal steering right.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh dear, I appear to have collided with ancient Greece.Argh!<|endoftext|>
|0| The Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| Argh! Stop everything.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's going on?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor! Bedroom!<|endoftext|>
|0| We have a rule about the bedroom.<|endoftext|>
|1| No one on this planet is safe right now. We have to solve thisbefore it's too late. Get your clothes on. If we move fast we at leaststand a chance and you have no idea what I'm talking about, do you?<|endoftext|>
|0| No.<|endoftext|>
|1| No. Helmic regulator again. Too early. Wrong point. As youwere.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, you can't just go like that. What's happening? Don't weneed to know?<|endoftext|>
|1| Popped up in the wrong order. Easy mistake to make. Nothing toalarm you. Forget I was ever here. I'll be back soon enough, I wouldhave thought. Everything's fine, pretty much. Don't worry about thefuture. The future is really (flashes of spoilers) safe. Really,really, safe. Sleep well.<|endoftext|>
|0| I really hate it when he does that.<|endoftext|>
|0| Whoa!<|endoftext|>
|0| Out of the way, Mister Pond. What? Why not?<|endoftext|>
|0| May I be of any assistance?<|endoftext|>
|0| Ood on the loo.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ood. Yes, I was wondering where he'd got to. I thought he'djust gone for a walk in the Tardis.<|endoftext|>
|0| Must have wandered off when I popped in the other night.If it was the other night.<|endoftext|>
|0| You know, I rescued him from the middle of the Androvaxconflict. I was taking him back to the Ood Sphere.<|endoftext|>
|1| Anyway, he's not being a nuisance, is he?<|endoftext|>
|0| Enjoy your workday experience.<|endoftext|>
|0| Cheers.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor. Doctor? He seems to think that he's our butler.<|endoftext|>
|1| He's conditioned to serve. The best thing is, let him do justthat. I'll come and pick him up tonight. Whenever tonight is. Oh no,got to go. Power drain's threatening to cause the Tardis to implode. Ohno, that's bad.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why's it doing that? No, no, no, no, no, don't do that!<|endoftext|>
|0| Your infusions. How else may I be of service?<|endoftext|>
|0| I feel so guilty.<|endoftext|>
|0| Just eat your breakfast.<|endoftext|>
|1| Me again. Sorry about the gaps in communications. Dropped yourOod back home. Reconnected it to the hive mind. Helmic regulator'sstill not working. Got hit by an arrow at Hastings Hill. Also rode ahorse through eleventh century Coventry. Also, I think I may haveaccidentally invented pasta. I popped round but you were out. Which isfine. Everything's all right, isn't it, with you two? Course it is.Ponds always fine. Just worrying unnecessarily. Anyway, just call me ifyou need me.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay? Toodle pip.<|endoftext|>
|0| Message deleted.<|endoftext|>
|0| We need you, raggedy man. I need you. <|endoftext|>
|1| I don't think I asked you to sit.<|endoftext|>
|0| There is a woman who wants to meet you.<|endoftext|>
|1| That's nice, but I'm married.<|endoftext|>
|0| Your help is required.<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't discuss my business in public.<|endoftext|>
|0| I know.<|endoftext|>
|1| Who are you?<|endoftext|>
|0| A messenger.<|endoftext|>
|1| Whose messenger?<|endoftext|>
|0| Darla von Karlsen.<|endoftext|>
|1| Never heard of her.<|endoftext|>
|1| Where's the tea room?<|endoftext|>
|0| You were never in the tea room.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh. Of course. Psychic projection. Someone's sending me a dreammessage. Well, I hope I fell asleep somewhere comfy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Do you recognise where you are?<|endoftext|>
|1| Can't remember. How do you hang up on this thing?<|endoftext|>
|0| You can't.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh yeah? And what if I just wake up?<|endoftext|>
|0| No, Doctor. The beach isn't real either. You are stilldreaming.<|endoftext|>
|0| Spacetime coordinates. You will meet Darla von Karlsen here.Her daughter is in danger, and only you can save her. You recognise theplanet?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Say it.<|endoftext|>
|1| No.<|endoftext|>
|0| Name the planet.<|endoftext|>
|1| I will not say that name.<|endoftext|>
|0| Say it.<|endoftext|>
|1| No!<|endoftext|>
|0| Name the planet. Name the planet. Name the planet.<|endoftext|>
|1| Skaro.<|endoftext|>
|0| First, there were the Daleks. And then, there was a man whofought them. And then, in time, he died. There are a few, of course,who believe this man somehow survived, and that one day he will return.For both our sakes, dearest Hannah, we must hope these stories aretrue.<|endoftext|>
|1| I got your message. Not many people can do that. Send memessages.<|endoftext|>
|0| I have a daughter, Hannah. She's in a Dalek prison camp. Theysay you can help.<|endoftext|>
|1| Do they? I wish they'd stop. I love your choice of meetingplace.<|endoftext|>
|0| They said I'd have to intrigue you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Skaro. The original planet of the Daleks. Look at the state ofit. Who told you about me?<|endoftext|>
|0| Does it matter?<|endoftext|>
|1| Maybe not, but you're very well informed. If Hannah's in aDalek prison camp, tell me, why aren't you?<|endoftext|>
|0| I escaped.<|endoftext|>
|1| (chuckles) No. Nobody escapes the Dalek camps. You're verycold.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's wrong?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's a trap.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is?<|endoftext|>
|1| You are, and you don't even know it.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Doctor is acquired.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'll just be a minute.<|endoftext|>
|0| Your husband is here.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hmm. I don't have a husband.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, well, apparently you still do.<|endoftext|>
|0| You have to sign these.<|endoftext|>
|0| And then we're not married?<|endoftext|>
|0| Just like magic.<|endoftext|>
|0| Can't chat. Working.<|endoftext|>
|0| Really? Thought you were just pouting at a camera.<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory?<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry, love. Was I interrupting?<|endoftext|>
|0| No.<|endoftext|>
|0| Gosh, look at you. You've gone so pale. Come on, take aseat. We'll soon sort that out.<|endoftext|>
|0| Amelia Pond is acquired.<|endoftext|>
|0| Cheers.<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory Williams is acquired.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where are we?<|endoftext|>
|0| So how much trouble are we in?<|endoftext|>
|0| How much trouble, Mister Pond?<|endoftext|>
|1| Out of ten? Eleven.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where are we? A spaceship, right?<|endoftext|>
|1| Not just any spaceship. The Parliament of the Daleks. Be brave.<|endoftext|>
|0| What do we do?<|endoftext|>
|1| Make them remember you. Well, come on then. You've got me. Whatare you waiting for? At long last, it's Christmas! Here I am.<|endoftext|>
|0| Save us. You will save us.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'll what?<|endoftext|>
|0| You will save the Daleks.<|endoftext|>
|0| Save the Daleks. Save the Daleks. Save the Daleks. Save theDaleks. Save the Daleks. Save the Daleks. Save the Daleks.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well.<|endoftext|>
|0| Save the Daleks.<|endoftext|>
|1| This is new.<|endoftext|>
|0| Day three six three. The terror continues. Also, madeanother soufflé, very nearly. Check defences. They came again lastnight. Still always at night. Maybe they're vampires. Oh, and it's mymum's birthday. Happy birthday, mum.<|endoftext|>
|0| I did make you a soufflé, but it was too beautiful to live.<|endoftext|>
|0| You will let us enter! We will enter! We will enter!<|endoftext|>
|0| What's he doing?<|endoftext|>
|0| He's chosen the most defendable area in the room, counted all theDaleks, counted all the exits, and now he's calculating the exactdistance we're standing apart and starting to worry. Oh, and look athim frowning now.<|endoftext|>
|0| Something's wrong with Amy and Rory, and who's going to fix it?And he straightens his bow tie.<|endoftext|>
|0| We have arrived.<|endoftext|>
|1| Arrived where?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Prime Minister will speak with you now.<|endoftext|>
|1| Do you remember who you were before they emptied you out andturned you into their puppet?<|endoftext|>
|0| My memories are only reactivated if they are required tofacilitate cover or disguise.<|endoftext|>
|1| You had a daughter.<|endoftext|>
|0| I know. I've read my file.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well?<|endoftext|>
|0| What do you know of the Dalek Asylum?<|endoftext|>
|1| According to legend, you have a dumping ground. A planet whereyou lock up all the Daleks that go wrong. The battle-scarred, theinsane, the ones even you can't control. It's never made any sense tome.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why not?<|endoftext|>
|1| Because you'd just kill them.<|endoftext|>
|0| It is offensive to us to extinguish such divine hatred.<|endoftext|>
|1| Offensive?<|endoftext|>
|0| Does it surprise you to know the Daleks have a concept ofbeauty?<|endoftext|>
|1| I thought you'd run out of ways to make me sick. Hello again.You think hatred is beautiful.<|endoftext|>
|0| Perhaps that is why we have never been able to kill you.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Asylum. It occupies the entire planet, right to the core.<|endoftext|>
|1| How many Daleks are in there?<|endoftext|>
|0| A count has not been made. Millions, certainly.<|endoftext|>
|1| All still alive?<|endoftext|>
|0| It has to be assumed. The Asylum is fully automated. Supervisionis not required.<|endoftext|>
|0| Armed?<|endoftext|>
|0| The Daleks are always armed.<|endoftext|>
|0| What colour? I'm sorry, there weren't any good questions left.<|endoftext|>
|0| This signal is being received from the very heart of the Asylum.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is the noise? Explain. Explain.<|endoftext|>
|1| Er, it's me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry, what?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's me, playing the triangle. Okay, I got buried in the mix.Carmen. Lovely show. Someone's transmitting this. Have you consideredtracking back the signal and talking to them? He asked the Daleks.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello? Hello? Carmen<|endoftext|>
|1| Hello?<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello?<|endoftext|>
|0| Come in. Come in.<|endoftext|>
|1| Come in, Carmen.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello! Yes, yes, sorry. Do you read me?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, reading you loud and clear. Identify<|endoftext|>
|0| Yourself and report your status.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello. Are you real? Are you actually, properly, real?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, confirmed. Actually, properly, real.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oswin Oswald, junior entertainment officer, starship<|endoftext|>
|0| Alaska. Current status, crashed andshipwrecked somewhere not nice. Been here a year, rest of the crewmissing. Provisions good but keen to move on.<|endoftext|>
|1| A year? Are you okay? Are you underattack?<|endoftext|>
|0| Some local lifeforms.<|endoftext|>
|0| Been keeping them out.<|endoftext|>
|0| Do you know what those lifeforms are?<|endoftext|>
|0| I know a Dalek when I hear one, yeah.<|endoftext|>
|1| What have you been doing on your ownagainst the Daleks for a year?<|endoftext|>
|0| Making soufflés?<|endoftext|>
|1| Soufflés? Against the Daleks? Where'd youget the milk?<|endoftext|>
|0| This conversation is irrelevant.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, it isn't.<|endoftext|>
|0| No! Hello? Hello?<|endoftext|>
|1| Because a starliner has crashed into yourAsylum, and someone's got in. And if someone can get in, theneverything can get out. A tsunami of insane Daleks. Even you don't wantthat.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Asylum must be cleansed.<|endoftext|>
|1| Then why is it still here? You've enough firepower on this shipto blast it out of the sky.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Asylum forcefield is impenetrable.<|endoftext|>
|1| Turn it off.<|endoftext|>
|0| It can only be turned off from within the Asylum.<|endoftext|>
|1| A small taskforce could sneak through a forcefield. Send in acouple of Daleks. Oh. (applauds) Oh. Oh, that's good. That's brilliant.You're all too scared to go down there. Not one of you will go, so tellme, what do the Daleks do when they're too scared?<|endoftext|>
|0| The Predator of the Daleks will be deployed.<|endoftext|>
|1| You don't have a Predator, and even if you did, why would theyturn off a forcefield for you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Because you will have no other means of escape.<|endoftext|>
|0| May I clarify? The Predator is the Dalek's word for you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Me? Me?<|endoftext|>
|0| You will need this. It will protect you from the nanocloud.<|endoftext|>
|1| The what? The nano what?<|endoftext|>
|0| The gravity beam will convey you close to the source of thetransmission. You must find a way to deactivate the forcefield fromthere.<|endoftext|>
|1| You're going to fire me at a planet? That's your plan? I getfired at a planet and expected to fix it.<|endoftext|>
|0| In fairness, that is slightly your M O.<|endoftext|>
|1| Don't be fair to the Daleks when they're firing me at a planet.<|endoftext|>
|1| What do you want with them?<|endoftext|>
|0| It is known the Doctor required companions.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, brilliant. Good oh.<|endoftext|>
|1| Don't worry. We'll get through this, I promise. Don't bescared.<|endoftext|>
|0| Scared? Who's scared. Geronimo.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ha! Oi!<|endoftext|>
|0| Argh!<|endoftext|>
|0| Wrong way up! Wrong way up!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello? Hello? Who are you? You okay?<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory? Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm Harvey. No. Who's Rory?<|endoftext|>
|0| Where are you going?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, ha, ha, ha.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry, sorry. Pressed the wrong switch.<|endoftext|>
|1| Soufflé girl?<|endoftext|>
|0| You can always call me Oswin, seeing asthat's my name. You okay?<|endoftext|>
|0| How are you doing that, eh? This is Dalektechnology.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's very easy to hack.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, it isn't. Where are you?<|endoftext|>
|0| The ship broke up when it hit. Somewhere underground, I think.You coming to get me?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|0| Hey! Oi! Soufflé girl!<|endoftext|>
|0| Damn.<|endoftext|>
|0| Come back!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy! Hey, where's Rory?<|endoftext|>
|0| There was another beam. There. Over there. Are you the rescueteam?<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello?<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory? Rory! Rory!<|endoftext|>
|0| We came down two days ago. There's twelveof our escape pods. I don't know what happened to them.<|endoftext|>
|0| Alaska? That's the same ship as soufflé girl.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah. Except she's been here a year.<|endoftext|>
|0| We should have some climbing rope longenough for that hole.<|endoftext|>
|1| Won't you introduce us to your crew?<|endoftext|>
|0| Ah, yes, sorry. Guys, this is the Doctor and Amy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Guys?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, my god.<|endoftext|>
|1| They're dead. All of them.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's not possible. I just spoke to them. Two hours ago. Wewere doing engine repairs.<|endoftext|>
|1| You're sure about that, are you? Because I'd say they've allbeen dead for a very long time.<|endoftext|>
|0| But they can't have been.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, they didn't get in this state in two hours.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, of course. Stupid me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Of course what?<|endoftext|>
|0| I died outside, and the cold preserved my body. I forgot aboutdying.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy, the door!<|endoftext|>
|0| Come on, come on.<|endoftext|>
|0| Explain. That's what you're good at. How'd he get all Daleked?<|endoftext|>
|1| Because he wasn't wearing one of these. Oh, ho, ho. That'sclever. The nanocloud. Microorganisms that automatically process anyorganic matter, living or dead, into a Dalek puppet. Anything attacksthis place, it automatically becomes part of the on-site security.<|endoftext|>
|0| Living or dead?<|endoftext|>
|1| These wristbands protect us. The only thing stopping us goingexactly the way he did<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, shut up! Living or dead?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, exactly. Living or, or<|endoftext|>
|1| Dead. Oh dear.<|endoftext|>
|0| Is it bad that I've really missed this?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Good.<|endoftext|>
|1| I know.<|endoftext|>
|0| Unauthorised personnel may not enter thecockpit.<|endoftext|>
|1| Shut up.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, Mister Grumpy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Bad combo. No sense of humour in that chin.<|endoftext|>
|0| Is that her again, soufflé girl?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, she. Oi, what is wrong with my chin?<|endoftext|>
|0| Careful, dear. You'll put someone's eye out.<|endoftext|>
|0| Scanning you. You're in another of theescape pods from the Alaska, right?<|endoftext|>
|0| Same ship I was on.<|endoftext|>
|0| How can you hack into everything? It should beimpossible. You're in a crashed ship!<|endoftext|>
|0| Long story. Is there a word for total screaming genius thatsounds modest and a tiny bit sexy?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor. You call me the Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| See what you did there.<|endoftext|>
|0| Check the floor. I'm picking up a breach at floor level. Therecould be a way out. See you later.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah ha! Hatch. Looks like it's been usedalready and they've tried to block it off behind them.<|endoftext|>
|0| Can't imagine why.<|endoftext|>
|1| The lower part of the pod is buried, so this must go straightdown to the Asylum.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where Rory is.<|endoftext|>
|1| Speaking of Rory, is there anything you want to tell me?<|endoftext|>
|0| Are we going to do this now?<|endoftext|>
|1| What happened?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, stuff. You know. We split up. What can you do?<|endoftext|>
|1| What can I do?<|endoftext|>
|0| Nothing. It's not one of those things you can fix like you fixyour bowtie. Don't give me those big wet eyes, Raggedy Man. It's life.Just life. That thing that goes on when you're not there.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, so somebody else got out this way, then.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, let's go and find them. Oh, hello, hello, hello. What arethey up to?<|endoftext|>
|0| What's that?<|endoftext|>
|1| One of these. (a wristband) But where did they get it?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, they got it from me.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, Amy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, what's going to happen to me? Seriously. Tell me what.<|endoftext|>
|0| Shush.<|endoftext|>
|0| What? Sorry, what?<|endoftext|>
|0| Eg eg eg eg eg eg eg.<|endoftext|>
|0| Eggs? You mean those things?<|endoftext|>
|0| Egg.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't, I don't know what you want. Those things. Are thosethings eggs? This? You want this.<|endoftext|>
|0| Egg. Stir. Min. Ate.<|endoftext|>
|0| Exterminate.<|endoftext|>
|0| Exterminate.<|endoftext|>
|0| Emergency. Emergency. Exterminate. Exterminate.<|endoftext|>
|0| Run! The door at the end, run for it. They're waking up,but they're slow. The door at the end. Just run. Now! Now! Now!<|endoftext|>
|0| Exterminate. Exterminate.<|endoftext|>
|0| So, anyway, I'm Oswin. What do I callyou?<|endoftext|>
|0| Er, I can't remember. Er, Rory.<|endoftext|>
|0| Lovely name, Rory. First boy I ever fanciedwas called Rory.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay.<|endoftext|>
|0| Actually, she was called Nina. I was going through a phase.<|endoftext|>
|0| Just flirting to keep you cheerful.<|endoftext|>
|0| Exterminate. Exterminate.<|endoftext|>
|0| Er, okay, any time you want to start flirting again is fine byme.<|endoftext|>
|0| So tell me, what's going to happen to me? And don't lie. Because Iknow when you're lying to me and I will definitely fall on you.<|endoftext|>
|1| The air all around is full of micro-machines. Robots the sizeof molecules. Nanogenes. Now that you're unprotected, you're beingre-written.<|endoftext|>
|0| So, what happens? I get one of those things sticking out of myhead?<|endoftext|>
|1| Physical changes come later.<|endoftext|>
|0| What comes first? How does it start?<|endoftext|>
|1| With your mind. Your feelings, your memories, and I'm sorry butit's started already.<|endoftext|>
|0| How do you know?<|endoftext|>
|1| Because we've had this conversation four times.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, scared now.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hang on to scared. Scared isn't Dalek.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hey there, beakie boy.<|endoftext|>
|0| If it's a straight choice, I prefer Nina.<|endoftext|>
|0| Loving this. The nose and the chin.<|endoftext|>
|0| You two could fence. There's a door behindyou.<|endoftext|>
|0| In there, quickly. Okay, you're safe for now. Pop your shirtoff, quick as you like.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why?<|endoftext|>
|0| Does there have to be a reason?<|endoftext|>
|0| What's that?<|endoftext|>
|1| Keep a look out. Don't open this door.Oswin!<|endoftext|>
|1| Oswin, can you hear me?<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello, the chin. I have visual on you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why don't I have a visual on you? Why can't I eversee you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Limited power, bad hair, take your pick. There's a door to yourleft. Open it.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm going to send you a map to thatscreen. I put your little friend somewhere safe. I can get you to him.<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory. You found Rory?<|endoftext|>
|0| I call him Nina. Personal thing. Hush now.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who are you? Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|0| How many Daleks directly aheadof me right now?<|endoftext|>
|0| Ten, twenty.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hard to say. Some of them arecatatonic but they do have firepower.<|endoftext|>
|1| How do I get past them? Amy!<|endoftext|>
|0| Shush. It's okay, it's just people in here.It's just people.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy, it's the nanocloud, it's altering your perception. Lookagain. Look again. Those aren't people.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy, come out. Take my hand. Run! Run!<|endoftext|>
|0| Look, they're coming down!<|endoftext|>
|1| Er, oh yes, they are.<|endoftext|>
|0| Intruder.<|endoftext|>
|1| Run.<|endoftext|>
|0| Intruder.<|endoftext|>
|0| Intruder.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's damaged.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, but what do we do?<|endoftext|>
|1| Identify me. Access your files. Who am I? Come on. Who's yourdaddy?<|endoftext|>
|0| You are the Predator.<|endoftext|>
|1| Access your standing orders concerning the Predator.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Predator must be destroyed.<|endoftext|>
|1| And how are you going to do that, Dalek? Without a gun you're atricycle with a roof. How are you going to destroy me?<|endoftext|>
|0| Self-destruct initiated.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's it doing?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's going to blow itself up, and I with it. Only weapon it'sgot left.<|endoftext|>
|0| Self-destruct cannot be countermanded.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm not looking for a countermand, dear. I'm looking forreverse.<|endoftext|>
|0| Forward, forward.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oswin?<|endoftext|>
|0| What was that? That was close.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oswin? What happened? Who killed all the Daleks?<|endoftext|>
|1| Who do you think?<|endoftext|>
|0| Will sleeping help her? Will it slow down the process?<|endoftext|>
|0| You'd better hope so<|endoftext|>
|0| Because pretty soon she's going to try andkill you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ow.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy. Still with us.<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy, it's me. Do you remember me?<|endoftext|>
|0| She remembers me.<|endoftext|>
|1| Same old Amy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Do you know how you make someone into aDalek? Subtract love, add anger. Doesn't she seem a bit too angry toyou?<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, somebody's never been to Scotland.<|endoftext|>
|1| What about you, though, Oswin. How come you're okay?<|endoftext|>
|0| Why hasn't the nanocloudconverted you?<|endoftext|>
|0| I mentioned the genius thing, yeah? Shielded in here.<|endoftext|>
|1| Clever of you. Now, this place. The Dalekssaid it was fully automated. Look at it. It's a wreck.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, I've had nearly a year to mess withthem, and not a lot else to do.<|endoftext|>
|0| A junior entertainment manager hiding out in awrecked ship, hacking the security systems of the most advanced warriorrace<|endoftext|>
|1| The universe has ever seen. But you knowwhat really gets me about you, Oswin? The soufflés. Where do you getmilk<|endoftext|>
|0| For the soufflés?<|endoftext|>
|1| Seriously. Is no one else wondering aboutthat?<|endoftext|>
|0| No. Frankly, no. Twice.<|endoftext|>
|0| So, Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| I've been looking you up. You're all overthe database. Why do the Daleks call you the Predator?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm not the Predator, I'm just a man with a plan.<|endoftext|>
|0| You've got a plan?<|endoftext|>
|0| That's all he is.<|endoftext|>
|0| There's a nose joke going if someone wants to pick that one off.<|endoftext|>
|1| In no particular order, we need to neutralise all the Daleks inthis Asylum, rescue Oswin from the wreckage, escape from this planetand fix Amy and Rory's marriage.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, I'm counting three lost causes. Anyone else?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oswin, there's a Dalek ship in orbit.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes. Got it on the sensors<|endoftext|>
|1| The Asylum has a forcefield. The Daleks upstairs are waitingfor me to turn it off. Soon as I do, they'll burn this whole world andus with it.<|endoftext|>
|0| So, Oswin, my question isthis. How fast can you drop the forcefield?<|endoftext|>
|0| Pretty fast. But why would I?<|endoftext|>
|0| Because this is a teleport. Am I right, Oswin?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah. Internal use only.<|endoftext|>
|1| I can boost the power. Once the forcefieldis down, I can use it to beam us right off this planet.<|endoftext|>
|0| You said when the forcefield is down, the Daleks will blow us up.<|endoftext|>
|1| We'll have to be quick, yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Fine, we'll be quick. But where do we beam to?<|endoftext|>
|1| The only place within range. The Dalek ship.<|endoftext|>
|0| They'll exterminate us on the spot.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ah, so this is the kind of escape plan where you survive aboutfour seconds longer.<|endoftext|>
|1| What's wrong with four seconds? You can do loads in fourseconds. Oswin, how fast can you drop the forcefield?<|endoftext|>
|0| I can do it from here, as soon as you comeand get me.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, just drop the forcefield and come tous.<|endoftext|>
|0| There's enough power in that teleport forone go. Why would you wait for me?<|endoftext|>
|1| Why wouldn't I?<|endoftext|>
|0| No idea. Never met you. Sending you a mapso you can come get me.<|endoftext|>
|0| This place is crawling with Daleks.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah. Kind of why I'm anxious to leave.Come up and see me sometime.<|endoftext|>
|0| So, are we going to go get her?<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't think that we have a choice. Okay, as soon as theforcefield is down the Daleks will attack. If it gets too explody-wodyin here, you go without me, okay?<|endoftext|>
|0| And leave you to die?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, don't worry about me. You're the one beaming up to a Dalekship to get exterminated.<|endoftext|>
|0| Fair point. Love this plan. What about Amy?<|endoftext|>
|1| Keep her remembering, keep her focused. That'll hold back theconversion.<|endoftext|>
|0| What do I do?<|endoftext|>
|1| You heard what she said. They're subtracting love. Don't letthem.<|endoftext|>
|0| Emergency. Emergency. Prepare to be annihilated.Emergency. We are the Daleks. We are the Daleks.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, look at me. I'm going to be logical.Cold and logical, okay? For both of our sakes, for both of us, I'mgoing to take this off my wrist and put it on yours.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why? Then it'll just start converting you. That's not better.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, but it'll buy us time, because it'll take longer with me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry, what?<|endoftext|>
|0| It subtracts love, that's what she said.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's that got to do with it? What does that even mean?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's arithmetic. It'll take longer with me because we both know,we've always known, that. Amy, the basic fact of our relationship isthat I love you more than you love me, which today is good news becauseit might just save both of our lives.<|endoftext|>
|0| How can you say that?<|endoftext|>
|0| Two thousand years, waiting for you outside a box. Don't say itisn't true, you know it's true. Give me your arm. Amy!<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't you dare say that to me. Don't you ever dare.<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy, you kicked me out.<|endoftext|>
|0| You want kids. You have always wanted kids. Ever since you were akid. And I can't have them.<|endoftext|>
|0| I know.<|endoftext|>
|0| Whatever they did to me at Demons Run, I can't ever give youchildren. I didn't kick you out. I gave you up.<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy, I don't<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't you dare talk to me about waiting outside a box, becausethat is nothing, Rory, nothing, compared to giving you up.<|endoftext|>
|0| Just give me your arm. Let me put this on you. Just give me yourarm!<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't touch me!<|endoftext|>
|0| It's the Doctor's. When you were sleeping<|endoftext|>
|0| That Time Lord. What's the betting he doesn't even need it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why didn't he just tell us?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oswin, I think I'm close.<|endoftext|>
|0| You are. Less than twenty feet away. Whichis the good news.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay. And the bad which I suddenly feel iscoming?<|endoftext|>
|0| You're about to pass through IntensiveCare.<|endoftext|>
|1| What's so special about this lot, then?<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't know.<|endoftext|>
|0| Survivors of particular wars. Spiridon,Kembel, Eridius, Vulcan, Exxilon. Ringing any bells?<|endoftext|>
|1| All of them.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah? How?<|endoftext|>
|1| These are the Daleks who survived me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's weird. Those ones don't usually wakeup for anything.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, well<|endoftext|>
|1| Special visitor. Okay, door, but it won'topen. I can't be far away, though.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hang on. Not quite sure. There's a releasecode. Let me just<|endoftext|>
|0| Anything out there?<|endoftext|>
|1| No.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hang on, I'm trying to think.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor. Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oswin, get this door open.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oswin, open this door!<|endoftext|>
|0| I can't!<|endoftext|>
|1| Oswin.<|endoftext|>
|0| Just get this door open!<|endoftext|>
|1| Oswin! Oswin, please! Get this door open!Help me!<|endoftext|>
|1| Stop!<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, that is cool.<|endoftext|>
|0| Tell me I'm cool, chin boy.<|endoftext|>
|1| What, what did you do?<|endoftext|>
|0| Hang on, I think I've found the doorthingy.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, tell me what you did.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Daleks, they have a hive mind. Well, they don't, theyhave a sort of telepathic web.<|endoftext|>
|1| The path web, yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| I hacked into it, did a mass delete<|endoftext|>
|0| On all the information connected withthe Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| You made them forget me?<|endoftext|>
|0| Good, eh? And here comes the door.<|endoftext|>
|1| I've tried hacking into the path web. Even I couldn't do it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Come and meet the girl who can. Hey, you'reright outside. Come on in.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oswin, we have a problem.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, we don't. Don't even say that. Joined the Alaska to see theuniverse, ended up stuck in a shipwreck first time out. Rescue me, chinboy, and show me the stars.<|endoftext|>
|0| Does it look real to you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Does what look real?<|endoftext|>
|0| Where you are right now.<|endoftext|>
|1| Does it seem real?<|endoftext|>
|0| It is real.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's a dream, Oswin. You dreamed it for yourselfbecause the truth was too terrible.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where am I?<|endoftext|>
|0| Where am I? Where am I?<|endoftext|>
|1| Because you are a Dalek.<|endoftext|>
|0| I am not a<|endoftext|>
|0| Dalek. I am not a Dalek!<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm human.<|endoftext|>
|1| You were human when you crashed here. Itwas you who climbed out of the pod. That was your ladder.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where am I? Where am I? Where am I?<|endoftext|>
|0| You mean?<|endoftext|>
|0| Human.<|endoftext|>
|1| Not any more. Because you're right. You're a genius. And theDaleks need genius. They didn't just make you a puppet, they did a fullconversion.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where am I? Where am I? Where amI?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oswin, I am so sorry, but you are a Dalek. Themilk, Oswin. The milk and the eggs for the soufflés. Where, where didit all come from?<|endoftext|>
|0| Eggs. I'm human. I am not a Dalek, I am human. I am notDalek, I am human!<|endoftext|>
|0| Eggs.<|endoftext|>
|1| It wasn't real. It was never real.<|endoftext|>
|0| I am a Dalek. I am a Dalek.<|endoftext|>
|0| Eggs.<|endoftext|>
|0| Stir. Min. Ate.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oswin.<|endoftext|>
|0| Eggs.<|endoftext|>
|0| Stir. Min ate.<|endoftext|>
|0| Exterminate.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oswin. No, no, no, Oswin. Oswin.<|endoftext|>
|0| Exterminate!<|endoftext|>
|1| Listen. Oswin, you don't have to do this.<|endoftext|>
|0| Exterminate!<|endoftext|>
|0| Oswin!<|endoftext|>
|0| Why do they hate you<|endoftext|>
|0| So much? They hate you so much. Why?<|endoftext|>
|1| I fought them many, many times.<|endoftext|>
|0| We have grown stronger in fear of you.<|endoftext|>
|1| I know. I tried to stop.<|endoftext|>
|0| Then run.<|endoftext|>
|0| What did you say?<|endoftext|>
|0| I've taken down the forcefield.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Daleks above have begun their attack.Run!<|endoftext|>
|0| Oswin, are you<|endoftext|>
|0| I am Oswin Oswald. I fought the Daleks and I am<|endoftext|>
|0| Human! Remember me.<|endoftext|>
|1| Thank you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Run!<|endoftext|>
|0| Run, you clever boy. And remember.<|endoftext|>
|0| How long can we wait?<|endoftext|>
|0| The rest of our lives.<|endoftext|>
|0| Agreed.<|endoftext|>
|1| Right, go! Let's go. We're good. Let's go. Oh, for God's sake.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Asylum is destroyed.<|endoftext|>
|0| Incoming teleport from Asylum planet. We are under attack.<|endoftext|>
|0| Prepare to defend. Defend. Defend!<|endoftext|>
|0| Explain, Dalek Supreme.<|endoftext|>
|0| You know, you guys should really have seen this coming.The thing about me and teleports, I've got a really good aim. Pin-pointaccurate, in fact. Or, to put it another way<|endoftext|>
|1| Suckers!<|endoftext|>
|0| Identify yourself. Identify. Identify.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's me. You know me. The Doctor. The Oncoming Storm. ThePredator.<|endoftext|>
|0| Titles are not meaningful in this context. Doctor who?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor who?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor who?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, Oswin. Oh, you did it to them all. You beauty.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor who? Doctor who?<|endoftext|>
|1| Fellas, you're never going to stop asking.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor who?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes! Yes!<|endoftext|>
|0| I can see you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay.<|endoftext|>
|1| Doctor who. Doctor who. Doctor Who! <|endoftext|>
|1| Bye, then. Lovely meeting you. Sorry about the mess.<|endoftext|>
|0| You think I'll just let you leave without me, after whatwe've just been through?<|endoftext|>
|1| You've got the Egyptian people to rule, Queen Nefertiti.They'll need reassuring after that weapon-bearing giant alien locustattack we just stopped rather brilliantly.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh dear, sorry. I've got it set to Temporal News For You.That's interesting.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is?<|endoftext|>
|1| Nothing. Not interesting. Not at all. Ooo, never been there.Exciting! I'm off!<|endoftext|>
|0| Coming!<|endoftext|>
|0| Craft size approximately ten millionsquare kilometres.<|endoftext|>
|1| A ship the size of Canada coming at Earth very fast. Any signsof life?<|endoftext|>
|0| We sent up a drone craft. It took these readings.<|endoftext|>
|1| Crikey, Charlie, look at that. Ooo, I know someone who'd loveto have a look at that. And the Ponds. Mustn't forget the Ponds, Neffy.Haven't seen them in ages. I'm riffing. People usually stop me when I'mriffing or carry on without me. That's also an option.<|endoftext|>
|0| Can you communicate with this craft?<|endoftext|>
|1| She's with me. Good question, Neffy.<|endoftext|>
|0| No. No response on any channel, in any recognised language. Ifit comes within ten thousand kilometres of Earth, we send up missiles.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, Indira, I liked you before you said missiles. How long tillthe ship gets that close?<|endoftext|>
|0| Six hours nineteen minutes.<|endoftext|>
|1| Right. Better get a shift on, then. Leave it with us. Come on,Neffy. We're going to need help.<|endoftext|>
|1| More stew?<|endoftext|>
|0| Where've you been, man? Seven months. You said you werepopping out for some liquorice. I had two very disappointed dancers onmy hands. Not that I couldn't manage.<|endoftext|>
|1| Riddell, listen. I've found, well, something.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, no, no, no, no. I shan't fall for that again. What is it?<|endoftext|>
|1| I've no idea. Do you want to find out?<|endoftext|>
|0| I think it's the fitting.<|endoftext|>
|0| Dad, it's not the fitting. It just needs a new bulb.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're wobbling the ladder.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm not. I don't want another loft incident.<|endoftext|>
|0| How's my side, Brian?<|endoftext|>
|0| Perfect, as ever, Amy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Thank you, Brian.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't know what he said to you to make you marry him, but he'sa lucky man.<|endoftext|>
|0| (sotto) Not here, not now.<|endoftext|>
|0| You leave the back door open?<|endoftext|>
|0| What is he doing?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm going to kill him.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hello! You weren't busy, were you? Well,even if you were, it wasn't as interesting as this probably is. Didn'twant you to miss it. Now, just a quick hop.<|endoftext|>
|1| Everybody grab a torch.<|endoftext|>
|1| Spiders. Don't normally get spiders in space.<|endoftext|>
|0| What the?<|endoftext|>
|1| Don't move! Do you really think I'm that stupid I wouldn'tnotice? How did you get aboard, eh? Transmat? Who sent you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor. That's my dad.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well frankly, that's outrageous.<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|1| You think you can just bring your dad along without asking? I'mnot a taxi service, you know.<|endoftext|>
|0| You materialised around us.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh. Well, that's fine, then. My mistake. Hello, Brian. How areyou? Nice to meet you. Welcome, welcome. This is the gang. I've got agang. Yes. Come on then, everyone.<|endoftext|>
|0| Tell him something, quick.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, thank you!<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm not entirely sure what's going on.<|endoftext|>
|0| You know when Amy and I first got married and we went travelling<|endoftext|>
|0| To Thailand.<|endoftext|>
|0| More the entirety of space and time. In that police box.<|endoftext|>
|0| All right, where are we? What is that noise and hello, ten months?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, I sense it's orbiting. More like pre-crashing. On aspaceship, don't know, and hello, Pond. Ten months. Time flies. Neverreally understood that phrase. This is Neffy, this is Riddell. They'rewith me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Charmed.<|endoftext|>
|0| With you? They're with you? Are they the new us? Is that why wehaven't seen you?<|endoftext|>
|1| No. They're just people. They're not Ponds. I thought we mightneed a new gang. Not really had a gang before. It's new.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's coming down.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is it?<|endoftext|>
|1| No idea.<|endoftext|>
|0| Not possible.<|endoftext|>
|1| Run!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|1| I know. Dinosaurs! On a spaceship!<|endoftext|>
|0| In here!<|endoftext|>
|0| I could take one of them. Short blow up into the throat.<|endoftext|>
|1| Or not. We've just found dinosaurs in space. We need topreserve them.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who's going to preserve us?<|endoftext|>
|0| Shush.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, so, how and whose ship?<|endoftext|>
|1| [on screen]<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry, sorry. Are you saying dinosaurs areflying a spaceship?<|endoftext|>
|1| Brian, please, that would be ridiculous. They're probably justpassengers. Did I mention missiles?<|endoftext|>
|0| Missiles?<|endoftext|>
|1| Didn't want to worry you. Anyway, six hours is a lifetime. Notliterally a lifetime. That's what we're trying to avoid. And we're allreally clever. Ooo, let's see what we can find out. Come on.<|endoftext|>
|0| How many dinosaurs do you think are on here?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, well done, whoever you are. Looking for engines. Thank you,computer. Look at that. Different sections have engines, but these looklike the primary clusters. Where are we now, computer? We need to getdown to these engines.<|endoftext|>
|0| What happened?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, great.<|endoftext|>
|1| Find out. What?<|endoftext|>
|0| We're outside. We're on a beach.<|endoftext|>
|1| Teleport. Oh, I hate teleports. Must have activated on myvoice.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ah, yes, well, thank you, Arthur C Clarke. Teleport, obviously.I mean, we're on a spaceship with dinosaurs. Why wouldn't there be ateleport? In fact, why don't we just teleport now?<|endoftext|>
|1| Is he all right?<|endoftext|>
|0| No, he hates travelling. Makes him really anxious. He only goesto the paper shop and golf.<|endoftext|>
|1| What did you bring him for?<|endoftext|>
|0| I didn't! Why can't you just phone ahead like any normal person?<|endoftext|>
|0| Somebody tell me where we are, now.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, it's not Earth. Doesn't taste right. Too metallic.<|endoftext|>
|0| Is that a kestrel?<|endoftext|>
|1| I do hope so.<|endoftext|>
|0| The beach is humming.<|endoftext|>
|1| Is it? Oh yes. Right, well, don't just stand there, you two.Dig. I'm going to look at rocks. Love a rock.<|endoftext|>
|0| Dig with what?<|endoftext|>
|0| Ah, well.<|endoftext|>
|0| Did you just have that on you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Of course. What sort of man doesn't carry a trowel? Put it onyour Christmas list.<|endoftext|>
|0| Dad, I'm thirty one. I don't have a Christmas list any more.<|endoftext|>
|1| I do!<|endoftext|>
|0| There's a floor under this beach.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor! Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|0| Do you hear that? Did you hear what he called him? Doctor.After all this time. Bring them to me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|0| There's clearly more than just two of these creatures.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hey, put that away. I need you sober.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's medicinal. And I don't take orders from females.<|endoftext|>
|0| Then learn. Any man who speaks to me that way, I execute.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're very welcome to try.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry, what was your name again?<|endoftext|>
|0| Lady of the Two Lands, wife of the great King Amenhotep,Queen Nefertiti of Egypt.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'll be damned.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, my god. Queen Nefertiti? I learned all about you at school.You're awesome. Big fan. High five. Yeah, bit behind on that. You'rereally famous.<|endoftext|>
|0| Shush. Listen.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay. At a guess, T Rex, not yet full size. We're in the middle ofa dinosaur nest.<|endoftext|>
|0| I propose a retreat.<|endoftext|>
|0| Perhaps forwards.<|endoftext|>
|0| Agreed. Just don't wake the baby.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, my god. Who are you, anyway?<|endoftext|>
|0| John Riddell, big game hunter on the African plains. I'm sureyou've heard of me, too.<|endoftext|>
|0| No.<|endoftext|>
|0| You clearly have some alarming gaps in your education.<|endoftext|>
|0| Or men who hunt defenceless creatures just don't impact onhistory. Face it, she's way cooler than you.<|endoftext|>
|0| And you, Amy. Are you also a Queen?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes. Yes, I am.<|endoftext|>
|1| See? Metal floors, screens in rocks. It was just a matter of ashort range teleport. We're still on the ship.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, we're outside on a beach.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's part of the ship, Dad.<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't be ridiculous.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, it is quite ridiculous. Also brilliant. That's why thesystem teleported us here. I wanted the engines. This is the engineroom! Hydrogenerators! Ha!<|endoftext|>
|0| I have literally no idea what he's saying.<|endoftext|>
|0| A spaceship powered by waves.<|endoftext|>
|1| Fabulously impossible. Oh, think of the things we could learnfrom this ship if we manage to stop it being blown to pieces.<|endoftext|>
|0| Plus not dying.<|endoftext|>
|1| Bad news, can't shut the wave system down in time. Takes, takesway too long.<|endoftext|>
|0| If these are the engines, there must be a control room.<|endoftext|>
|1| Exactly. That's what we need to find. Now, what do we do aboutthe things that aren't kestrals?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh my lord. Are those pterodactyls?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes. On any other occasion, I'd be thrilled. Exposed on abeach, less thrilled. We should be going.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where?<|endoftext|>
|1| Er, definitely away from them.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's the plan?<|endoftext|>
|1| That's the plan. Amendments welcome. Move away from thepterodactyls.<|endoftext|>
|0| I think they might be noticing.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amendment one, run!<|endoftext|>
|0| Why don't we just teleport or something?<|endoftext|>
|1| No! Local teleport burnt out on arrival. There's something inthe cliffs over there.<|endoftext|>
|0| Come on!<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm trying!<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you all right?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, I'm fine. Right, what do we do now? There's no way back outthere.<|endoftext|>
|1| Through the cave. Come on.<|endoftext|>
|1| That suggestion was a work in progress.<|endoftext|>
|0| We're trapped.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, thanks for spelling it out.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, whatever's down there is coming this way.<|endoftext|>
|1| Spelling it out is hereditary. Wonderful.<|endoftext|>
|0| That sound's getting nearer.<|endoftext|>
|0| We're very cross with you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Bit of weed killer wouldn't go amiss in here.<|endoftext|>
|0| Whoever was running this vessel left in a hurry.<|endoftext|>
|0| Maybe a plague came and took them.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, there'd be corpses and bones.<|endoftext|>
|0| Unless the animals ate them.<|endoftext|>
|0| Whoa, Chuckle Brothers. Lighten up, would you?<|endoftext|>
|0| How'd you know how to do that?<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, I've spent enough time with the Doctor to know whenever youenter somewhere new, press buttons.<|endoftext|>
|0| What else have you learned from him?<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't stop at button pressing.<|endoftext|>
|0| One hundred and seventeen years.<|endoftext|>
|0| Data records.<|endoftext|>
|0| The ship's owners?<|endoftext|>
|0| Could be. Come on. Help us out.<|endoftext|>
|0| Mainly cryogenic.<|endoftext|>
|0| I will continue to work<|endoftext|>
|0| How about a picture, huh? Come on, for me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Far beyond our<|endoftext|>
|0| Look. Oh, it's beautiful.<|endoftext|>
|0| I can't tell how far we have come. Far enough toavoid the destructive impact forecast for our planet. Far enough for meto feel a profound sense of loss.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is that?<|endoftext|>
|0| Silurian.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're going straight on the naughtystep.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's the escape plan?<|endoftext|>
|1| Why do we want to escape?<|endoftext|>
|0| They have us hostage.<|endoftext|>
|0| They're taking us somewhere. We might learn from it.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, you see? He's so clever. I've missed you, Rory.<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't do that.<|endoftext|>
|0| What if they kill us?<|endoftext|>
|1| They wouldn't do that. You're not going to kill us, are you,Rusty?<|endoftext|>
|0| Who are you calling Rusty?<|endoftext|>
|1| Have you seen yourselves lately?<|endoftext|>
|0| You try being on this ship for two millennia. See how yourpaintwork does.<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't listen to him. He's just being mean because we capturedhim.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, my goodness.<|endoftext|>
|0| Whoa!<|endoftext|>
|1| Ooo!<|endoftext|>
|1| Herbivore. Don't panic. Triceratops. Ha! Beautiful.<|endoftext|>
|0| Shall I shoot it?<|endoftext|>
|0| We're not supposed to shoot the creatures, stupid.<|endoftext|>
|0| Stop calling me stupid.<|endoftext|>
|1| Roar yourself. Hello, cutie. Good boy. Who's a lovely Tricythen? Yes, you are. Yes, you are.<|endoftext|>
|0| What do I do? What do I do?<|endoftext|>
|0| What're you doing? What're you doing?<|endoftext|>
|1| You don't have any vegetable matter in your trousers, do you,Brian?<|endoftext|>
|0| Only my balls.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm sorry?<|endoftext|>
|0| Golf balls. Grassy residue.<|endoftext|>
|0| What are you carrying those around for?<|endoftext|>
|0| Urgh.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, bless.<|endoftext|>
|0| Get it away from me.<|endoftext|>
|1| Throw one.<|endoftext|>
|0| Really? Is this what you want? Is it?<|endoftext|>
|1| And breath out. Right, take us to your leader.<|endoftext|>
|0| Really?<|endoftext|>
|1| Too good to resist.<|endoftext|>
|0| Of the fifty species loaded,only one has had any difficulty surviving. All the others are thriving,and we expect them to be able to repopulate.<|endoftext|>
|0| We're on an Ark. A Silurian Ark.<|endoftext|>
|0| Lizard people herding dinosaurs onto a Space Ark? Absolutetommyrot.<|endoftext|>
|0| Only an idiot denies the evidence of their own eyes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Egyptian Queen or not, I shall put you across my knee andspank you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh lord.<|endoftext|>
|0| Try, and I'll snap your neck in a heartbeat.<|endoftext|>
|0| They certainly bred firecrackers in your time.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, no, no, please don't start flirting. I will not have flirtingcompanions.<|endoftext|>
|0| If the Doctor trusts Amy, so do I. Stop doubting her.<|endoftext|>
|0| If this ship was built by<|endoftext|>
|0| Silurians, yeah.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where are they?<|endoftext|>
|0| That's a surprisingly good question. Display life signs for HomoReptilia.<|endoftext|>
|0| But where have they gone?<|endoftext|>
|0| Perhaps they found another world, left the ship.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why are the dinosaurs still on board, and why is the ship comingback to Earth? It doesn't make sense. What's changed between then andnow? Wait. Computer, show me the ship at launch with all life signals.Now show me the ship today with all life signals. Thousands less. Butwhy? Show me both images, then and now, side by side.<|endoftext|>
|0| What are you looking for?<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, two images. Spot the difference. What changed? What happenedto the Silurians?<|endoftext|>
|0| The centre.<|endoftext|>
|0| Computer, zoom in to the centre. Hold on.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is it?<|endoftext|>
|0| Another spacecraft. This ship's been boarded before.<|endoftext|>
|1| Love what you've done to the place down here.<|endoftext|>
|0| Let him in. Open the gate.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's fine. It's fine.<|endoftext|>
|0| He's not interested in you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Look, you need to learn some manners.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, you need to learn some manners.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, you do.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, you do, Mister Manners.<|endoftext|>
|1| Fantasia in F minor for four hands.<|endoftext|>
|0| You know it.<|endoftext|>
|1| Know it? Say hello to hands three and four. Schubert kepttickling me to try to put me off. Franz the hands. Oh, that takes meback. Well, this is cosy.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's fate you came.<|endoftext|>
|1| Is it? I'm the Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, I know. I'm Solomon.<|endoftext|>
|1| What's that?<|endoftext|>
|0| System malfunction. Ignore it.<|endoftext|>
|1| What happened to you?<|endoftext|>
|0| I was attacked. Three raptors. They cornered me. The robotsrescued me but it was nearly too late.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah yes, the robots. They're unusual.<|endoftext|>
|0| I got them cheap from a concession on Alyria Seven. The robotsdid as best they could with my legs, but you can help me so much more.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh. A doctor doctor. I see. Let's have a look.<|endoftext|>
|0| They chewed through part of the bone in my legs.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes. Very nasty.<|endoftext|>
|0| But you can repair them.<|endoftext|>
|1| If you tell me how you came by so many dinosaurs.<|endoftext|>
|0| Injure the older one.<|endoftext|>
|1| What?<|endoftext|>
|0| Dad! Dad! It's all right, Dad. It's okay.<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't respond well to violent, Solomon.<|endoftext|>
|0| And I don't like questions, Doctor. You boarded without mypermission. Now, fix me, or the next bolt will be fatal.<|endoftext|>
|0| I will take you apart cog by cog and melt you down when all thisis over.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, I'm so scared. Actually, I might be. A little bit of oiljust came out.<|endoftext|>
|0| Now, stay still. It's just a burn, it's nothing serious.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's that?<|endoftext|>
|0| You carry a trowel, I carry a med-pack. It's all about thepockets in our family. This is an ice patch. It cools the skin.<|endoftext|>
|0| Never seen one of those.<|endoftext|>
|0| I pick up cool stuff wherever we go. For some people it's carsand hardware, for me it is nursing supplies. Now, painkiller. Thiswon't hurt.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ow.<|endoftext|>
|0| I lied. It won't hurt from now on, though. All right, you'redone.<|endoftext|>
|0| Thanks.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's all right. You get to see my awesome nursing skills inaction for once.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's that?<|endoftext|>
|0| Your phone's ringing. In space.<|endoftext|>
|0| You get used to it. I have to take this. The wife. Hello, missus.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where are you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Still on board. Met some pterodactyls andsome rusty robots I'm going to melt down.<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory, this is a Silurian ship.<|endoftext|>
|0| How did you get on board, Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, I never talk about myself with a gun pointed at me. Let'stalk about you. Your cosy little craft embedded in a vast old ship.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're very observant.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm a Sagittarius, probably.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm transporting it to the Roxborne Peninsula.<|endoftext|>
|1| A commerce colony. You're a trader.<|endoftext|>
|0| I search out opportunities for profit across nine galaxies.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah, the purple light. That's what it was. An IV system,identifying value. The database of everything across space and timeallocated a market value. Argos for the universe. You were trying tofind out how much I'm worth.<|endoftext|>
|0| Would you like to know?<|endoftext|>
|0| You don't exist. It's never done that.<|endoftext|>
|1| That's me. Worthless. Unlike these creatures you have on board.Very valuable, given they're extinct. Done. Sit up, very slowly.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor? Amy.<|endoftext|>
|1| I need to take this.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy.<|endoftext|>
|0| This is an Ark built by the Silurians. Theywere looking for another planet.<|endoftext|>
|1| Where are they now?<|endoftext|>
|0| None on board. I mean, thousands of stasispods, all empty.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'll see you soon.<|endoftext|>
|1| (sotto) Be ready.<|endoftext|>
|0| The pain in my legs is gone. I can move them. Thank you,Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| What did you do to the Silurians?<|endoftext|>
|0| We ejected them. The robots woke them from cryosleep a handfulat a time and jettisoned them from the airlocks. We must have left atrail of dust and bone.<|endoftext|>
|1| Because you wanted the dinosaurs.<|endoftext|>
|0| Their ship crossed my path. I sent out a distress signal, theylet me board, and when I saw the cargo things became more complex.<|endoftext|>
|1| Piracy and then genocide.<|endoftext|>
|0| Very emotive words, Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, I'm a very emotive man.<|endoftext|>
|0| The lizards wouldn't negotiate. I made them a generous offer.<|endoftext|>
|1| The creatures on board this ship are not objects to be sold ortraded.<|endoftext|>
|0| I feel like you're judging me.<|endoftext|>
|1| You said Roxborne Peninsula, so why are you heading to Earth?You're on the wrong course. Oh, you don't know how. Brilliant. Youcouldn't change the pre-programmed course without instructions. Theship defaulted, returned home. Oh dear. The Silurians outwitted youeven after you'd massacred them, so now you're a prisoner on the shipyou hijacked.<|endoftext|>
|0| Not now you're here. You going to help me go wherever I wantto go, Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| Little bit of news, Solomon. You're being targeted by missiles.Get off this ship while you still can.<|endoftext|>
|0| You think I believe that? You just want them for yourself. Youwon't profit from me, Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| Don't ever judge me by your standards.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, don't just stand there, Rory. (to robots) Hey, he wantsto see you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Dad, up!<|endoftext|>
|0| What are we doing?<|endoftext|>
|1| Just do exactly as I do.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, no!<|endoftext|>
|1| Geronimo!<|endoftext|>
|0| Did you call?<|endoftext|>
|0| What are you doing? Stop them!<|endoftext|>
|0| All right, don't shout.<|endoftext|>
|0| Useless machines.<|endoftext|>
|1| Go, Tricy. Run like the wind!<|endoftext|>
|0| After them.<|endoftext|>
|1| Quick, how do you start a Triceratops?<|endoftext|>
|0| There they are.<|endoftext|>
|0| I know, I saw them before you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Tricy, fetch.<|endoftext|>
|1| Go, Tricy.<|endoftext|>
|0| They've stolen a dinosaur.<|endoftext|>
|0| I can see that.<|endoftext|>
|1| Come on, Tricy, faster, baby!<|endoftext|>
|0| They're turning off. We're losing them.<|endoftext|>
|0| Which way did they go?<|endoftext|>
|0| I thought you were looking.<|endoftext|>
|0| No. Now they've got away.<|endoftext|>
|0| We definitely used to be faster.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm riding a dinosaur on a spaceship.<|endoftext|>
|1| I know!<|endoftext|>
|0| I only came round to fix your light.<|endoftext|>
|1| Come on, Tricy. Where are the brakes?<|endoftext|>
|1| Good. That worked. Okay. Er, where are we now? Ooo, incomingmessage from Earth. Hello, Earth, how's things?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, the ship's coming through the atmosphere. Ihave to start the missile programme.<|endoftext|>
|1| No. No, no, no, don't do that. Everything's completely undercontrol here. Turning round any moment. Need a bit of wriggle room onthe timings.<|endoftext|>
|0| I can't do that.<|endoftext|>
|1| You can. Of course you can. Tiny bit more time, Indira, please.This ship contains the most precious cargo.<|endoftext|>
|0| My only responsibility is the Earth's safety. I'mlaunching the missiles. Goodbye, Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, Indira. Hey! Come back! Please!<|endoftext|>
|0| Target identified. Navigation systemslocking on to target. Missile launch procedure initiated. Estimatedimpact, thirty minutes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Now, these are what we need. Dinosaurprotection.<|endoftext|>
|0| No weapons.<|endoftext|>
|0| Anaesthetic? These are stun guns. You're almost clever.<|endoftext|>
|0| Enough to make a dinosaur take a nap. Even the Doctor couldn'tobject to that.<|endoftext|>
|0| You and the Doctor, are you his Queen?<|endoftext|>
|0| No, I'm Rory's Queen. Wife. Wife. I am his wife. Please don't tellhim I said I was his Queen. I'll never hear the end of it.<|endoftext|>
|0| And the Doctor, does he have a Queen?<|endoftext|>
|0| I thought you had a husband?<|endoftext|>
|0| The male equivalent of a sleeping potion.<|endoftext|>
|0| You clearly need a man of action and excitement. One with avery large weapon.<|endoftext|>
|0| So, human sleeping potion or walking innuendo. Take your pick.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's very bad indeed. Completely unhelpful.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doesn't the ship have any defence systems installed?<|endoftext|>
|1| Good thinking, Rory.<|endoftext|>
|1| Computer, show us weapons and defence systems.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, well, that was a waste of time, wasn't it? Getting my hopesup like that.<|endoftext|>
|0| What ship doesn't have weapons?<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah, they're ancient species, Rory. Still full of hope.<|endoftext|>
|0| What about the control deck? You said we should go to thecontrol deck next.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's too late. It won't make any difference.<|endoftext|>
|0| We could at least try.<|endoftext|>
|1| It won't work, Rory. The missiles are locked on.<|endoftext|>
|0| So what, we're just giving up?<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't know. I don't know.<|endoftext|>
|0| You were telling the truth, Doctor. Earth has launchedmissiles. This vessel is too clumsy to outrun them, but I have my ownship.<|endoftext|>
|1| You won't get your precious cargo on board, though. Just be youand your metal tantrum machines.<|endoftext|>
|0| We do not have tantrums!<|endoftext|>
|0| Shut up. You're right, Doctor. I can't keep the dinosaurs andlive myself. But I had the IV system scan the entire ship, and it foundsomething even more valuable. Utterly unique. I don't know where youfound it, or how you got it here, but I want it.<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't know what you're talking about.<|endoftext|>
|0| Earth Queen Nefertiti of Egypt.<|endoftext|>
|0| A face stamped across history.<|endoftext|>
|0| Give her to me, and I'll let the rest ofyou live.<|endoftext|>
|1| No.<|endoftext|>
|0| You think I won't punish those who get in my way, whateverthey're worth?<|endoftext|>
|1| You must be very proud.<|endoftext|>
|0| Bring her to me, or the robots will make their way throughyour corpses. Bring her now.<|endoftext|>
|1| No.<|endoftext|>
|1| What are you doing?<|endoftext|>
|0| I demanded to be brought here.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, no, no, no, no way.<|endoftext|>
|0| It isn't your choice, Doctor, it's mine.<|endoftext|>
|1| Listen to me. If you go with him, I can't guarantee yoursafety.<|endoftext|>
|0| You saved my people. I am in your debt.<|endoftext|>
|1| No. No debts. You don't owe me anything.<|endoftext|>
|0| Then I do it on my own.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, Neffy, Neffy.<|endoftext|>
|0| No! Take her and I shoot you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Put your weapon down. Let me make my choice.<|endoftext|>
|0| Do it, boy.<|endoftext|>
|0| My bounty increases. And what an extraordinary bounty you are.<|endoftext|>
|0| Never touch me.<|endoftext|>
|0| I like my possessions to have spirit. It means I can have funbreaking them. And I will break you in with immense pleasure. Thankyou, Doctor. Computer, take us back to my ship.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hostile targeting in progress. Hostile targeting in progress.Hostile targeting in progress. Hostile targeting in progress.<|endoftext|>
|1| Bingo.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is it? Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay, control deck.<|endoftext|>
|0| So, what's the plan?<|endoftext|>
|1| Come on. The missiles are locked onto us. We can't out-runthem. We have to save the dinosaurs and get Nefertiti back fromSolomon. Isn't it obvious?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's sort of the opposite of obvious.<|endoftext|>
|1| Seventeen minutes before the missiles hit. We need to turn thisship around.<|endoftext|>
|0| You said it was too late. That there wasn't any time.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah, yes, but I didn't have this plan then, did I? Riddell? Keepan eye out for dinosaurs.<|endoftext|>
|0| I was rather hoping you'd say that.<|endoftext|>
|1| No killing any. Rory, Brian, get rid of the cobwebs.<|endoftext|>
|0| Come on, come on, we're not moving. He's magnetised us. Wecan't move away.<|endoftext|>
|0| Come on, boy. I'll get you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hell's teeth, that's really not fair.<|endoftext|>
|0| Missile target will be reached in elevenminutes.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, don't be like that. Really unhelpful.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's the matter?<|endoftext|>
|1| Parallel pilot compartments, both configured. Needs twooperator of the same gene-chain. And that's why Solomon couldn't changethe ship's course and neither can we.<|endoftext|>
|1| What?<|endoftext|>
|0| We can. Me and Rory. We must be the same gene-thingy you said.<|endoftext|>
|1| Brian Pond, you are delicious.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm not a Pond.<|endoftext|>
|1| Course you are. Sit down, both of you, licketty split. The shipdoes all the engineering. The controls are straight forward. Even amonkey use them. Oh look, they're going to. Guys, come on. Comedy gold.Where's a Silurian audience when you need one. Anyway, two eye linescreens. Velocity and trajectories. Steer away from the Earth. Try notto bump into the moon otherwise the races who live there will be livid.<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|1| Primary controls in the arms of the chairs. Principle's thesame as any vehicle. Eight minutes forty five seconds.<|endoftext|>
|1| Get us as far away as you can. Right, phase two sorted. Now forphase one.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh no, phase two comes after phase one.<|endoftext|>
|1| Humans, you are so linear. Shine the torch in here.<|endoftext|>
|0| What are you doing?<|endoftext|>
|1| Mixing my messages. How's the job?<|endoftext|>
|0| We're about to be hit by missiles and you're asking me that?<|endoftext|>
|1| I work best when I'm multitasking. Keep talking. How's the job?<|endoftext|>
|0| I gave it up.<|endoftext|>
|1| You gave the last one up.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, well, I can't settle. Every minute I'm listening out forthat stupid Tardis sound.<|endoftext|>
|1| Right, so it's my fault now, is it?<|endoftext|>
|0| I can't not wait for you, even now. And they're getting longer,you know, the gaps between your visits. I think you're weaning us offyou.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm not, I promise. Really promise. The others, yeah, but notyou. Rory and you, you have lives, have each other. I thought that'swhat we agreed.<|endoftext|>
|0| I know. I just worry there'll come a time when you never turn up.That something will have happened to you and I'll still be waiting,never knowing.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, come on, Pond. You'll be there till the end of me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Or vice versa.<|endoftext|>
|1| Don't.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor? This is a two man job.<|endoftext|>
|0| What are you doing?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm easily worth two men. You can help too, if you like.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, what are you going to do<|endoftext|>
|0| Quickens the blood, doesn't it?<|endoftext|>
|0| The sooner this lot go back to being extinct, the better.<|endoftext|>
|0| You know what I want more than anything?<|endoftext|>
|0| Lessons in gender politics?<|endoftext|>
|0| A dinosaur tooth to take home. Dinosaurs ahead, a lady at myside, about to be blown up. I'm sure I've never been happier.<|endoftext|>
|0| Shut up and shoot.<|endoftext|>
|0| Duck!<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm flying a spaceship. Rory!<|endoftext|>
|0| Hmm?<|endoftext|>
|0| We're flying a spaceship.<|endoftext|>
|0| I know.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ship's trajectory is changing.<|endoftext|>
|0| It makes no difference. The missiles have locked on. How longtill target?<|endoftext|>
|0| Seven minutes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Here we go! That's it, that's it. That'sit, that's it. Me, me, me. Yes, yes. It's better than golf.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hello! Having trouble leaving?<|endoftext|>
|0| Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer, do.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ship's still magnetised. Just couldn't bear to lose you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Release my ship, Doctor, or I kill this precious littleobject.<|endoftext|>
|0| I am not your possession now, nor will I ever be. Now, staythere.<|endoftext|>
|1| Don't mess with Egyptian Queens, Solomon. I hope you've learntthat now.<|endoftext|>
|0| What are you doing?<|endoftext|>
|1| Disabling this ship's signal and replacing it with the one fromthe Silurian ship. I send this craft off emitting the signal they'relooking for, the missiles will follow. Hopefully, Siliurian ship safe,dinosaurs safe, everybody safe. Bit tight for time, though. Shouldn'treally be chatting. Neffy, let's go. How remiss of me. Almost forgot.The thing about missiles, very literal. This is what they latch on to.<|endoftext|>
|1| Now, one press of this and the ship's demagnetised.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, whatever you want, I can get it for you. Whateverobject you desire.<|endoftext|>
|1| Did the Silurians beg you to stop? Look, Solomon. The missiles.See them shine? See how valuable they are. And they're all yours.<|endoftext|>
|0| You wouldn't leave me, Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| Enjoy your bounty.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|1| So, dinosaur drop off time.<|endoftext|>
|0| Actually, we think home for us.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh. Fine. Of course.<|endoftext|>
|0| Not for ever, just a couple of months.<|endoftext|>
|1| Right. Yes. I'm pretty busy anyway. I mean, I've got to dropeveryone back.<|endoftext|>
|0| About that. Can I ask a favour? There's something I want to see.<|endoftext|>
|0| More postcards from your dad.<|endoftext|>
|0| Do you know what? I think it is the fitting.<|endoftext|>
|0| I knew you'd find me eventually.<|endoftext|>
|0| Make peace with your gods.<|endoftext|>
|0| Once they were your gods, too.<|endoftext|>
|0| Not any more.<|endoftext|>
|0| Am I, am I the last one?<|endoftext|>
|0| There's one more. The Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| Mercy. Eighty one residents.<|endoftext|>
|0| Look at this. It's a load of stones and lumps of wood. What is it?<|endoftext|>
|1| A load of stones and lumps of wood.<|endoftext|>
|0| The sign does say Keep Out.<|endoftext|>
|1| I see Keep Out signs as suggestions more than actual orders,like Dry Clean only.<|endoftext|>
|1| That's not right.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's a street lamp.<|endoftext|>
|1| An electric street lamp about ten years too early.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's only a few years out.<|endoftext|>
|1| That's what you said when you left your phone charger in Henrythe Eighth's en-suite.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, er<|endoftext|>
|1| Anachronistic electricity, Keep Out signs, aggressive stares.Has someone been peeking at my Christmas list?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| Tea. But the strong stuff. Leave the bag in.<|endoftext|>
|0| What're you doing here, son?<|endoftext|>
|1| Son? You can stay.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sir, might I enquire who you is?<|endoftext|>
|1| Of course. I'm the Doctor. This is<|endoftext|>
|1| No need to stand. You see that? Manners. Oh, thank you.<|endoftext|>
|1| But I don't need a new suit.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm the undertaker, sir.<|endoftext|>
|0| I got a question. Is you an alien?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, er, bit personal. It's all relative, isn't it? I mean, Ithink you're the aliens, but in this context, yes. Yes, I suppose I am.<|endoftext|>
|1| Guys!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor! Put him down!<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't think we won't kill you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Leave him alone!<|endoftext|>
|1| Rory, everything is completely under control. Guys, guys, guys.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ow.<|endoftext|>
|0| He's coming. Oh God, he's coming.<|endoftext|>
|0| Preacher, say something.<|endoftext|>
|0| Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.<|endoftext|>
|0| Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done.<|endoftext|>
|0| You, bow tie. Get back across that line.<|endoftext|>
|0| Now.<|endoftext|>
|0| Isaac, he said he was a doctor. An alien doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| That a reason to hand him to his death?<|endoftext|>
|0| Isaac, it could be him.<|endoftext|>
|0| You know it ain't.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ma'am.<|endoftext|>
|0| Just letting him go like that? Be seeing you, boy.<|endoftext|>
|1| What was that outside?<|endoftext|>
|0| The Gunslinger. Showed up three weeks back. We've been prisonersever since. See that border line stretching round the town? Woke up onemorning, there it was. Nothing gets past it, in or out. No supplywagons, no reinforcements. Pretty soon the whole town's going to starveto death.<|endoftext|>
|0| But you let us in.<|endoftext|>
|0| You ain't carrying any food. Just three more mouths to feed.We'll all die even sooner now.<|endoftext|>
|1| What happens if someone crosses the line?<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah, well, he wasn't a very good shot, then.<|endoftext|>
|0| He was aiming for the hat.<|endoftext|>
|1| He shoots people's hats?<|endoftext|>
|0| It was a warning shot.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah, no, yes. I see. Hmm.<|endoftext|>
|0| What does he want? Has he issued some kind of demand?<|endoftext|>
|0| Says he wants us to give him the alien doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| But that's you. Why would he want to kill you? Unless he's metyou.<|endoftext|>
|0| And how could he know that we'd be here? (sotto) We didn't evenknow we'd be here.<|endoftext|>
|0| We were aiming for Mexico. The Doctor was taking us to see the Dayof the Dead Festival.<|endoftext|>
|0| Mexico's two hundred miles due south.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, that's what happens when people get toast crumbs on theconsole. Anyway, I think it's about time I met him, don't you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Who?<|endoftext|>
|1| The chap outside said I could be the alien doctor, but you saidI wasn't, so you already know who it is. Two alien doctors. We're likebuses. Resident eighty one, I presume, so beloved by the townsfolk hewarranted an alteration to the sign. Probably because he rigged upthese electrics, and I'm guessing he's in here, because if half thetown suddenly wanted to throw me to my death, this is where I'd want tobe.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't know what you<|endoftext|>
|0| Isaac, I think the time for subterfuge has passed. Good afternoon.My name is Kahler-Jex. I'm the doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| The Kahler. I love the Kahler. They're one of the mostingenious races in the galaxy. Seriously, they could build a spaceshipout ofTupperware and moss.<|endoftext|>
|0| All right. How did you get here?<|endoftext|>
|0| My craft crashed about a mile or so out of town. I would have diedif Isaac and the others hadn't pulled me from the wreckage.<|endoftext|>
|1| And you stayed, as their doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| On my world I was a surgeon, so it seemed logical. And it gave mean opportunity to repay my debt to them.<|endoftext|>
|0| Listen to him. Talking like it was nothing. Tell them about thecholera.<|endoftext|>
|0| Now, Isaac, I'm sure our guests are<|endoftext|>
|0| Two years after he arrived, there was an outbreak of cholera.Thanks to the doc here, not a single person died.<|endoftext|>
|0| A minor infection we'd found a treatment for centuries ago.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, no, what, what do you call them? The electrics?<|endoftext|>
|0| Using my ship as a generator, I was able to rig up somerudimentary heating and lighting for the town.<|endoftext|>
|1| So why does the Gunslinger want you?<|endoftext|>
|0| It don't matter.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm just saying, if we knew that<|endoftext|>
|0| America's the land of second chances. We called this town Mercyfor a reason. Others, some round here, don't feel that way.<|endoftext|>
|0| Now, Isaac, we've discussed this.<|endoftext|>
|0| People whose lives you've saved are suddenly saying we shouldhand you over.<|endoftext|>
|0| They're scared, that's all. You can hardly blame them.<|endoftext|>
|0| Them being scared scares me. War only ended five years back.That old violence is still under the surface. We give up Doc Jex, thenwe hand the keys of the town over to chaos.<|endoftext|>
|1| Did you try to repair your craft? Surely someone with yourskills<|endoftext|>
|0| It really was very badly damaged.<|endoftext|>
|1| We evacuate the town. Our ship's just over the hills, room foreveryone. I'll pop out, bring it back here, Robert's your uncle.<|endoftext|>
|0| Really? Simple as that. No crazy schemes, no negotiations.<|endoftext|>
|1| I've matured. I'm twelve hundred years old now. Plus I don'twant to miss The Archers.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, so you're not even a tiny bit curious?<|endoftext|>
|1| Why would I be curious? It's a mysterious space cowboyassassin. Curious? Of course I'm not curious.<|endoftext|>
|0| Son? You've still got to get past the Gunslinger. How you goingto do that?<|endoftext|>
|1| With a little sleight of hand.<|endoftext|>
|0| You okay?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm fine, yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Keep moving. Next time, you get to wear Jex's clothes.<|endoftext|>
|1| Can I borrow your horse, please? It'sofficial Marshal business.<|endoftext|>
|0| He's called Joshua. It's from the Bible. It means theDeliverer.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, he isn't. I speak horse. He's called Susan, and he wantsyou to respect his life choices.<|endoftext|>
|0| Er, I think he's seen us.<|endoftext|>
|0| This way.<|endoftext|>
|0| When this is all done, do you want us to takeyou home?<|endoftext|>
|0| Thank you, but I've already given everything I have to the Kahler.My skills, energy, all that was good in me. Here, I could start afresh.I could remember myself and help people. That's all I ever wanted todo, end suffering.<|endoftext|>
|0| Here.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're a mother, aren't you.<|endoftext|>
|0| How did you know?<|endoftext|>
|0| There's kindness in your eyes. And sadness, but a ferocity too.<|endoftext|>
|0| Life's not exactly straight forward.<|endoftext|>
|0| It seldom is.<|endoftext|>
|0| And what about you? Are you a father?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes. In a way, I suppose I am.<|endoftext|>
|0| So, we're waiting till the Doctor comes topick us up in your ship.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, I know. I was there when we agreed it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, I said that more for my benefit than yours.<|endoftext|>
|1| Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Yes, I know we're in a hurry. Ijust want to check something out. Two ticks.<|endoftext|>
|1| There's something niggling me. Yes, yes, it could be important.Oi, don't swear.<|endoftext|>
|1| Whoa, whoa, whoa. Yes, I wear a Stetson now.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, a good point, Susan. Where is the damage?<|endoftext|>
|0| That's the alarm on my ship.<|endoftext|>
|0| Maybe the Doctor wants to get it working again?<|endoftext|>
|0| But that wasn't the plan. He's not following the plan.<|endoftext|>
|0| Welcome to my world.<|endoftext|>
|0| Security breach. You have ten seconds to enter the pass code.<|endoftext|>
|0| Or this vehicle will self-destruct. Thank you for choosingAbarakas Security software. Incinerating intruders for three centuries.Nine, eight, seven. Self-destruct overridden.<|endoftext|>
|1| This is an awful lot of security for a titchy spacecraft.<|endoftext|>
|0| Awaiting command.<|endoftext|>
|1| Tell me everything you can about the Gunslinger.<|endoftext|>
|0| File not found. Please choose from Technical Specifications,Flight Recorder, Personal Files, Maps and Charts.<|endoftext|>
|1| Personal files of Doctor Kahler-Jex.<|endoftext|>
|0| Names of deceased subjects can be found on the drop downmenu.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm sorry, Amy. He really should have followed the plan.<|endoftext|>
|1| Don't shoot, don't shoot, don't shoot. I know who you are, andwho Jex is, too.<|endoftext|>
|1| Now, what I don't understand is why you haven't just walkedinto town and killed him.<|endoftext|>
|0| People will get in the way.<|endoftext|>
|1| You want justice, you deserve justice, but this isn't the way.We can put him on trial<|endoftext|>
|0| When he starts killing your people, you can use yourjustice.<|endoftext|>
|0| Isaac says he doesn't care about my past, butthings may have been uncovered that even he might struggle to forgive,so it's best we beat a hasty retreat.<|endoftext|>
|0| We? I'm coming with you?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's unlikely the Gunslinger will shoot if I'm with you. As far asI can tell, he's programmed to take innocent lives only if absolutelynecessary.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, well, colour me reassured.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doc? What are you doing?<|endoftext|>
|0| No more warning shots. I'll kill thenext person to step over that line. Make sure it's Jex.<|endoftext|>
|0| It was stupid of me, I realise that now. Ijust thought I'd put you all in enough danger. Perhaps if I left<|endoftext|>
|1| He's lying. Every word, every thing he says, it's all lies.This man is a murderer.<|endoftext|>
|0| I am a scientist.<|endoftext|>
|1| Sit down. Sit down! Tell them what you are.<|endoftext|>
|0| What am I? A war hero.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, somebody want to tell me what is going on?<|endoftext|>
|1| The Gunslinger is a Cyborg.<|endoftext|>
|0| A what?<|endoftext|>
|1| Half man, half machine. A weapon. Jex built it. He and his teamtook volunteers, told them they'd been selected for special training,then experimented on them, fused their bodies with weaponry, andprogrammed them to kill.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay. Why? Why would you do that, Doc?<|endoftext|>
|0| We'd been at war for nine years. A war that had already decimatedhalf of our planet. Our task was to bring peace, and we did. We builtan army that routed the enemy and ended the war in less than a week. Doyou want me to repent, to beg forgiveness for saving millions of lives?<|endoftext|>
|1| And how many died screaming on the operating table before youhad found your advantage?<|endoftext|>
|0| War is another world. You cannot apply the politics of peace towhat I did. To what any of us did.<|endoftext|>
|0| What happened then? How come you're here?<|endoftext|>
|0| When the war ended we had the Cyborgs decommissioned, but one ofthem must have got its circuitry damaged in battle. It went offline andbegan hunting down the team that created it until just two of us wereleft. We fled, and our ships crashed here.<|endoftext|>
|0| So, what do we do with Jex?<|endoftext|>
|0| What do we do with him?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah. I mean, he's a war criminal.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, he's the guy that saved the town from cholera, the guy thatgave us heat and light.<|endoftext|>
|0| Look, Jex may be a criminal and yeah, kind of creepy<|endoftext|>
|0| And still in the room.<|endoftext|>
|0| But I think we should put aside what he did and find anothersolution.<|endoftext|>
|0| Another solution? It's him or us.<|endoftext|>
|0| When did we start letting people get executed? Did I miss a memo?Doctor, tell him.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hmm? Yes. I don't know. Whatever Amy said.<|endoftext|>
|0| Looking at you, Doctor, is like looking into a mirror, almost.There's rage there, like me. Guilt, like me. Solitude. Everything butthe nerve to do what needs to be done. Thank the gods my people weren'trelying on you to save them.<|endoftext|>
|1| No. No, but these people are. Out! Out! Out!<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, you're really letting him do this?<|endoftext|>
|0| Save us all? Yeah, I really am.<|endoftext|>
|0| No!<|endoftext|>
|1| Go on.<|endoftext|>
|1| Get over, and don't come back.<|endoftext|>
|0| You wouldn't.<|endoftext|>
|1| I genuinely don't know.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor. Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Let him come back, Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| Or what? You won't shoot me, Amy.<|endoftext|>
|0| How do you know? Maybe I've changed. I mean, you've clearly beentaking stupid lessons since I saw you last.<|endoftext|>
|0| I didn't mean to do that.<|endoftext|>
|0| Everyone who isn't an American, drop your gun.<|endoftext|>
|1| We can end this right now. We could save everyone right now.<|endoftext|>
|0| This is not how we roll, and you know it. What happened to you,Doctor? When did killing someone become an option?<|endoftext|>
|1| Jex has to answer for his crimes.<|endoftext|>
|0| And what then? Are you going to hunt down everyone who's made agun or a bullet or a bomb?<|endoftext|>
|1| But they coming back, don't you see? Every time I negotiate, Itry to understand. Well, not today. No. Today, I honour the victimsfirst. His, the Master's, the Dalek's, all the people who died becauseof my mercy!<|endoftext|>
|0| You see, this is what happens when you travel alone for too long.Well, listen to me, Doctor. We can't be like him. We have to be betterthan him.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amelia Pond. Fine, fine. We think of something else. Butfrankly, I'm betting on the Gunslinger.<|endoftext|>
|1| Jex, move over the line. Now.<|endoftext|>
|0| Make peace with your gods.<|endoftext|>
|0| Kahler-Tek, isn't it? I remember all your names, even now. I'llnever hurt anyone again. I'm even helping people here.<|endoftext|>
|0| Last chance. Make peace with your gods.<|endoftext|>
|0| No!<|endoftext|>
|1| Isaac. Isaac. Isaac. It's okay, it's okay. We can get you toJex's surgery. He can save you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Listen to me. You've got to stay. You've got to look aftereveryone.<|endoftext|>
|1| It won't come to that, Isaac.<|endoftext|>
|0| Protect Jex. Protect my town. You're both good men. You justforget it sometimes.<|endoftext|>
|1| Take Jex to his cell. If anything happens to him, you'll haveme to answer to.<|endoftext|>
|1| This has gone on long enough.<|endoftext|>
|0| You are right. You've got until noon tomorrow. Give him tome or I'll kill you all.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, my god. You're the Marshal.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah. And you're the Deputy.<|endoftext|>
|1| Come in.<|endoftext|>
|0| Marshal. Ma'am. Fella. You need to come outside.<|endoftext|>
|1| Why, what's wrong?<|endoftext|>
|0| Just come outside. And you should put that on.<|endoftext|>
|1| What's going on?<|endoftext|>
|0| He in there? Leave the keys and take a walk. By the time youget back, this'll all be done.<|endoftext|>
|1| I promised Isaac I'd protect him.<|endoftext|>
|0| Protecting him got Isaac dead. Tomorrow, it's going to be usall, dead.<|endoftext|>
|0| We thought Isaac was right to fight, but it's different now.We've got to say, all right we lost, and give that thing what it wants.<|endoftext|>
|0| What it wants is to kill our friend.<|endoftext|>
|0| We don't got any ill feeling towards the Doc. We just thinkingabout our families. Hand him over and we all safe again.<|endoftext|>
|1| You know I can't do that.<|endoftext|>
|0| We got us a problem.<|endoftext|>
|1| Please don't do this.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why, reckon you're quicker than me?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, certainly not, but this? Lynch mobs? A town turning againstitself? This is everything Isaac didn't want.<|endoftext|>
|1| How old are you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Nearly nineteen.<|endoftext|>
|1| That's eighteen, then. Too young to have fought in the war, soI'm guessing you've never shot anyone before, have you?<|endoftext|>
|0| First time for everything.<|endoftext|>
|1| But that's how all this started. Jex turned someone into aweapon. Now that same story's going to make you a killer, too. Don'tyou see? Violence doesn't end violence, it extends it, and I don'tthink you want to do this. I don't think you want to become that man.<|endoftext|>
|0| There's kids here.<|endoftext|>
|1| I know, who I can save if you'll let me.<|endoftext|>
|0| He really worth the risk?<|endoftext|>
|1| Don't know. But you are.<|endoftext|>
|1| Frightened people. Give me a Dalek any day.<|endoftext|>
|0| Fresh coffee, Marshal. For what it's worth, I know you'regoing to save us. Isaac made you Marshal for a reason, and if you'regood enough for him, you're good enough for me. Reckon you should knowthat.<|endoftext|>
|1| Thank you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oi. Get out of it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Let me guess. The good folk of Mercy wanted me to take a littlestroll into the desert. You could turn a blind eye. No one would blameyou. You'd be a hero.<|endoftext|>
|1| But I can't, can I. Because then Isaac's death would meannothing. Just another casualty in your endless bloody war. Do you wantme to hand you over? Is that what you want? Do you even know?<|endoftext|>
|0| You think I'm unaffected by what I did? That I don't hear themscreaming every time I close my eyes? It would be so much simpler if Iwas just one thing, wouldn't it? The mad scientist who made thatkilling machine, or the physician who's dedicated his life to servingthis town. The fact that I'm both bewilders you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, I know exactly what you are, and I see this reformation forwhat it really is. You committed an atrocity and chose this as yourpunishment. Don't get me wrong, good choice. Civilised hours, lots ofadulation, nice weather, but, but justice doesn't work like that. Youdon't get to decide when and how your debt is paid.<|endoftext|>
|0| In my culture, we believe that when you die your spirit has toclimb a mountain carrying the souls of everyone you wronged in yourlifetime. Imagine the weight I will have to lift. The monsters Icreated, the people they killed. Isaac, he was my friend. Now his soulwill be in my arms, too. Can you see now why I fear death? You want tohand me over. There's no shame in that. But you won't. We all carry ourprisons with us. Mine is my past. Yours is your morality.<|endoftext|>
|1| We all carry our prisons with us. Ha!<|endoftext|>
|0| Help me. Help me to<|endoftext|>
|0| Ready?<|endoftext|>
|0| Ready?<|endoftext|>
|0| Disengage. It's a trick.<|endoftext|>
|0| (sotto) Save us, O Lord.<|endoftext|>
|1| Go! Just go! I can't save them while you're here.<|endoftext|>
|0| Nine, eight, seven. Self destructoverridden.<|endoftext|>
|0| Deactivate automatic targeting. Switchto manual.<|endoftext|>
|1| Right.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where is he?<|endoftext|>
|1| He's gone.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where? Answer me.<|endoftext|>
|1| Away from here. Look up. Any second now you'll see the vapourtrail of his ship. This is their home, not the backdrop for yourrevenge. Lookup, go after him, take this battle away from<|endoftext|>
|0| Kahler-Tek.<|endoftext|>
|0| Kahler-Tek.<|endoftext|>
|0| Jex. Coward.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where are you?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm in my ship.<|endoftext|>
|1| What are you doing? Just go!<|endoftext|>
|0| Where are you from?<|endoftext|>
|0| Where on Kahler?<|endoftext|>
|1| Now? You're asking him this now?<|endoftext|>
|0| Gabriah.<|endoftext|>
|0| I know it. It's beautiful there. When this isover, will you go back?<|endoftext|>
|0| How can I?<|endoftext|>
|0| I am a monster now.<|endoftext|>
|0| So am I.<|endoftext|>
|1| Just go! Finish this!<|endoftext|>
|0| I'll find you. If I have to tear this universe apart, Iwill find you.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't doubt that.<|endoftext|>
|0| You'll chase me to another planet<|endoftext|>
|0| And another race will be caught in thecross-fire.<|endoftext|>
|0| Face me!<|endoftext|>
|0| Count down to self-destruct resumed.<|endoftext|>
|0| Face me!<|endoftext|>
|0| No. You've killed enough.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm ending the war for you, too.<|endoftext|>
|0| Count down to self-destruct<|endoftext|>
|0| Resumed.<|endoftext|>
|1| What's going on?<|endoftext|>
|0| Ten.<|endoftext|>
|0| The count down.<|endoftext|>
|1| What's going on? Jex!<|endoftext|>
|0| Thank you, Doctor. I have to face<|endoftext|>
|0| The souls of those I've wronged.<|endoftext|>
|0| Five<|endoftext|>
|0| Perhaps they will be kind.<|endoftext|>
|0| Three, two, one, zero.<|endoftext|>
|0| He behaved with honour at the end. Maybe more than me.<|endoftext|>
|1| We could take you back to your world. You could help with thereconstruction.<|endoftext|>
|0| I will walk into the desert and self-destruct. I'm acreature of war. I have no role to play during peace.<|endoftext|>
|1| Except maybe to protect it.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay, so, our next trip. Oh! You know all the monkeys and dogsthey sent into space in the fifties and sixties? You will never guesswhat really happened to them.<|endoftext|>
|0| Could we leave it a while? Our friends are going to start noticingthat we're aging faster than them.<|endoftext|>
|1| Another time? No worry.<|endoftext|>
|0| By the time the Gunslinger arrived, the people of Mercywere used to the strange, the impossible. Where he came from didn'tmatter. As a man once said, America is a land of second chances. Do Ibelieve the story? I don't know. My great-grandmother must have been alittle girl when he arrived. But next time you're in Mercy, ask someonewhy they don't have a Marshal or Sheriff or policeman there. We've gotour own arrangement, they'll say, then they'll smile like they got asecret. Like they've got their own special angel watching out for them.Their very own angel who fell from the stars. <|endoftext|>
|0| It's Lane's Opticians. Just reminding you yourreading glasses are ready for collection. Bye!<|endoftext|>
|0| Milk two months out of date. Yogurt.<|endoftext|>
|0| Eek! Don't ask.<|endoftext|>
|0| We've run out of washing tablets.<|endoftext|>
|0| We have two lives. Real life and Doctor life.Except real life doesn't get much of a look in.<|endoftext|>
|0| What do we do?<|endoftext|>
|0| Choose?<|endoftext|>
|0| Not today, though.<|endoftext|>
|0| Nah, not today.<|endoftext|>
|0| Every time we flew away with the Doctor, we'd just becomepart of his life. But he never stood still long enough to become partof ours. Except once. The year of the slow invasion. The time theDoctor came to stay.<|endoftext|>
|0| Dad, it's half past six in the morning.<|endoftext|>
|0| What are you doing lying around? Haven't you seen them?<|endoftext|>
|0| What are they?<|endoftext|>
|0| Nobody knows. They're everywhere.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, where have they come from? Wait.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|1| Invasion of the very small cubes. That's new.<|endoftext|>
|0| (Matthew Amroliwala) World leaders are appealing for calm.<|endoftext|>
|0| (Joanna Gosling?) After the global appearance of millions ofsmall cubes. Despite official warnings, people have been taking thecubes from the streets into offices and homes.<|endoftext|>
|0| What are they?<|endoftext|>
|0| Where do they come from?<|endoftext|>
|0| And why are they here?<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, they're certainly not random spacedebris. They're too perfectly formed for that. Are theyextra-terrestrial in origin? Well, you'll have to ask a better man thanme.<|endoftext|>
|1| All absolutely identical. Not a singlemolecule's difference between them. No blemishes, imperfections,individualities.<|endoftext|>
|0| What if they're bombs? Billions of tiny bombs? Or transportcapsules maybe, with a mini robot inside. Or deadly hard drives. Oralien eggs? Or messages needing decoding. Or they're all parts of abigger whole. Jigsaw puzzles that need fitting together.<|endoftext|>
|1| Very thorough, Brian. Very, very thorough. Well done. Stayhere. Watch these. Yell if anything happens.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, is this an alien invasion? Because that's what it feelslike.<|endoftext|>
|0| There couldn't be life-forms in every cube, could there?<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't know. And I really don't like not knowing.<|endoftext|>
|1| Right, I need to use your kitchen as a lab. Cook up some cubes.See what happens.<|endoftext|>
|0| Right, I'm due at work.<|endoftext|>
|1| What? You've got a job?<|endoftext|>
|0| Of course I've got a job. What do you think we do when we're notwith you?<|endoftext|>
|1| I imagined mostly kissing.<|endoftext|>
|0| I write travel articles for magazines and Rory heals the sick.<|endoftext|>
|0| My shift starts in an hour. You don't know where my scrubs are?<|endoftext|>
|0| In the lounge, where you left them.<|endoftext|>
|0| Approaching site. Quite strong likeness detected. Targetunconfirmed. May be hostile.<|endoftext|>
|0| Approaching source now. Area will be secure in sixty seconds.Ultimate force available.<|endoftext|>
|1| All the Ponds, with their house and theirjobs and their everyday lives. The journalist and the nurse. Long wayfrom Leadworth.<|endoftext|>
|0| We think it's been ten years. Not for you or Earth, but for us.Ten years older. Ten years of you, on and off.<|endoftext|>
|1| Look at you now. All grown up.<|endoftext|>
|0| Clear! Trap one, kitchen secured.<|endoftext|>
|0| Trap three, back garden secured.<|endoftext|>
|0| There are soldiers all over my house, and I'm in my pants.<|endoftext|>
|0| My whole life I've dreamed of saying that, and I miss it by beingsomeone else.<|endoftext|>
|0| All these muscles, and they still don't know how to knock. Sorryabout the raucous entrance. Spike in Artron energy reading at thisaddress. In the light of the last twenty four hours, we had to check itout, and the dogs do love a run out. Hello. Kate Stewart, head ofscientific research at UNIT. And with dress sense like that.<|endoftext|>
|0| You must be the Doctor. I hoped it would be you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Tell me, since when did science run the military, Kate?<|endoftext|>
|0| Since me. UNIT's been adapting. Well, I dragged them along,kicking and screaming, which made it sound like more fun than itactually was.<|endoftext|>
|1| What do we know about these cubes?<|endoftext|>
|0| Far less than we need to. We've been freighting them in fromaround the world for testing. So far, we've subjected them totemperatures of plus and minus two hundred Celsius, simulated a waterdepth of five miles, dropped one out of a helicopter at ten thousandfeet and rolled our best tank over it. Always intact.<|endoftext|>
|1| That's impressive. I don't want them to be impressive. I wantthem vulnerable with a nice Achilles heel.<|endoftext|>
|0| We don't know how they got here, what they're made of, or whythey're here.<|endoftext|>
|1| And all around the world, people are picking them up and takingthem home.<|endoftext|>
|0| Like iPads have dropped out of the sky. Taking them to work,taking pictures, making films, posting them on Flickr and YouTube.Within three hours, the cubes had a thousand separate Twitter accounts.<|endoftext|>
|1| Twitter?<|endoftext|>
|0| I've recommended we treat this as a hostile incursion. Gatherthem all up and lock them in a secure facility. But that would takemassive international agreement and co-operation.<|endoftext|>
|1| We need evidence. The cubes arrived in plain sight, in vastquantities, as the sun rose. So, what does that tell us?<|endoftext|>
|0| Maybe they wanted to be seen. Noticed.<|endoftext|>
|1| Or more than that, they want to be observed. So we observethem. Stay with them round the clock. Watch the cubes, day and night.Record absolutely everything about them. Team cube, in it together.<|endoftext|>
|1| Four days. Nothing! Nothing! Not a singlechange in any cube anywhere in the world. Four days, and I am still inyour lounge!<|endoftext|>
|0| You were the one who wanted to observe them.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, well, I thought they'd do something, didn't I? Not justsit there while everyone eats endless cereal!<|endoftext|>
|0| You said we had to be patient.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, you! You, not me! I hate being patient. Patience is forwimps. I can't live like this. Don't make me. I need to be busy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Fine! Be busy! We'll watch the cubes.<|endoftext|>
|1| (keeping the football off the ground.) Ninety eight, ninetynine, one hundred. Amy!<|endoftext|>
|1| Four million nine hundred ninety nine, five million.<|endoftext|>
|1| That's better. Nothing like a bit of activity to pass the time.How long was I gone?<|endoftext|>
|0| Er, about an hour.<|endoftext|>
|1| I can't do it. No.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where are you going?<|endoftext|>
|1| Brian, you're still here.<|endoftext|>
|0| You told me to watch the cubes.<|endoftext|>
|1| Four days ago.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ah! Doesn't time fly when you're alone with your thoughts?<|endoftext|>
|0| You can't just leave, Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, of course I can. Quick jaunt, restore sanity. Ooo, hey,come if you like.<|endoftext|>
|0| They can't just go off like that.<|endoftext|>
|1| Can't they? Can't you? That's how it goes, isn't it?<|endoftext|>
|0| I've got my job.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh yes, Rory. The universe is awaiting, but you have a littlejob to.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's not little. It's important to me. Look, what you do isn'tall there is.<|endoftext|>
|1| I never said it was.<|endoftext|>
|1| All right. Fine. I'll be back soon. Monitor the cubes. Call me.I'll have the Tardis set to every Earthnews feed.<|endoftext|>
|0| At the end of a week of cubic questions and theories,but no answers, could this be the greatest stealth marketing campaignin business history? And if it is, will those behind it ever comeforward and explain exactly what it's for?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm so pleased for you two. It's about timeyou made an honest woman of her.<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy, about bridesmaids. You've missed quite a few things thelast year or two.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm so totally there. Whatever you need.<|endoftext|>
|0| <|endoftext|>
|0| Ah, well, thanks.<|endoftext|>
|0| But there are months when we don't see you. And we can't dowithout you. I want you to go full time.<|endoftext|>
|0| Full time? Blimey. Er.<|endoftext|>
|0| I said yes. I committed.<|endoftext|>
|0| And I committed to being a bridesmaid. Months in advance. Like Iknow I'm going to be here.<|endoftext|>
|0| So the Doctor's God knows where, the cubes aren't doing anythingat all. Did real life just get started?<|endoftext|>
|0| I like it.<|endoftext|>
|0| So do I.<|endoftext|>
|0| Brian's log, day sixty seven.<|endoftext|>
|0| You, er, you can't call it that. Brian's log?<|endoftext|>
|0| Brian's log, day sixty seven. Cube was quiet all night, 0nceagain. Cube was quiet all day, as per previously. No movement. Nochange in measurements. End of entry.<|endoftext|>
|0| You stay up and watch it all the time.<|endoftext|>
|0| I film it while I'm asleep. When I wake up, I watch the footageon fast forward. I e-mail the result to UNIT. My middle name isdiligence.<|endoftext|>
|0| Wow. I can't wait to see day sixty eight.<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't mock my log. I'm doing what the Doctor asked.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's it. Er, Mister Ryan, please.<|endoftext|>
|0| Again?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm fine. I've been done.<|endoftext|>
|0| What seems to be the matter?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm just waiting for a prescription.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where does it hurt?<|endoftext|>
|0| I said I'm fine. Will you tell your colleague here that I.Stop!<|endoftext|>
|0| Hey! Doctor, it's me. Hello. So, the UN classified the cubes asprovisionally safe, whatever that means, and Banksy and Damien Hirstput out statements saying the cubes are nothing to do with them. Andthe cubes, well, they're just here. Still. What's it been, nine months?People are just taking them for granted. Maybe we'll never know whythey came. But anyway. I got to Laura's wedding. It was great. She'shere tonight, being as it's our wedding anniversary. We thought youmight have dropped by. I left you messages.<|endoftext|>
|1| I know! Happy anniversary! Come with me. And bring yourhusband.<|endoftext|>
|1| 26th of June, 1890. The recently openedSavoy Hotel. Dinner, bed and breakfast for two. Bonjour, bonjour.Merci, Auguste. You'll be back before the party's over. They won't evennotice you went. No complications, I promise.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ooo!<|endoftext|>
|1| Bit of a shock, Zygon ship under the Savoy, half the staffimpostors. Still, it's all fixed now, eh?<|endoftext|>
|0| Gentlemen, open the doors!<|endoftext|>
|0| I thought we were going home?<|endoftext|>
|1| You can't miss a good wedding. Under the bed. Under the bed!<|endoftext|>
|1| Shush!<|endoftext|>
|0| It wasn't my fault.<|endoftext|>
|0| It was totally your fault!<|endoftext|>
|0| Somebody was talking, and I just said yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| To wedding vows! You just married Henry VIII on our anniversary.<|endoftext|>
|1| Sorry.<|endoftext|>
|0| How long were they away?<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't know what you're talking about, Brian.<|endoftext|>
|0| Because they're wearing totally different clothes from earlier.<|endoftext|>
|1| Seven weeks. I got side-tracked. A lot.<|endoftext|>
|0| What happened to the other people who travel with you?<|endoftext|>
|1| Some left me. Some got left behind. And some, not many but,some died. Not them. Not them, Brian. Never them.<|endoftext|>
|1| Can I stay here, with you and Rory, for abit. Keep an eye on the cubes. However long that takes.<|endoftext|>
|0| I thought it would drive you mad.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, no, no. I mean, I'll be better at it this time. I miss you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Brian's log, day three hundred and sixtyone. Eight fifty pm. No movement. And I am cream crackered.<|endoftext|>
|0| I sent you out to sell as manycubes as you could in twenty four hours. And look at you, you've made aright hash of it, haven't you. Well, Craig, you're fired.<|endoftext|>
|1| If I had a restaurant, this'd be all I'd serve.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, right. You running a restaurant.<|endoftext|>
|1| I've run restaurants. Who do you think invented the Yorkshirepudding?<|endoftext|>
|0| You didn't.<|endoftext|>
|1| Pudding, yet savoury. Sound familiar?<|endoftext|>
|0| Do it again.<|endoftext|>
|0| Good job, mister. Civilisations saved,surfaces wiped. What more could any woman ask for?<|endoftext|>
|0| Ha, ha.<|endoftext|>
|0| I mean it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where's the Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|0| On the Wii again. I'm going for a bath.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, yes! Second set, Doctor! Ha ha! Oh, ifFred Perry could see me now, eh? He'd probably ask for his shorts back.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ow!<|endoftext|>
|1| Third set decider, come on, then.<|endoftext|>
|1| Out of the way, dear, I'm trying to. Whatever you are, thisplanet, these people, are precious to me. And I will defend them to mylast breath. Is that all you can do, hover? I had a metal dog could dothat.<|endoftext|>
|1| What's that?<|endoftext|>
|1| Ooo, you really have woken up.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor? Hi. Er, the cube in there, it just opened.<|endoftext|>
|0| The cube upstairs just spiked me and took my pulse!<|endoftext|>
|1| Ha! Really? Mine fired laser bolts and now it's surfing thenet.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're never going to believe this. My cube just moved. Itrattled.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello?<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory, mate, I'm desperate for help. Peopleare saying they've been attacked by the cubes. It's going to be a longnight.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, I'm on my way.<|endoftext|>
|0| I have to get to work. They need all the helpthey can get.<|endoftext|>
|0| Let me come, help out.<|endoftext|>
|0| Take your dad to work night, brilliant! Okay, are you going to beall right here?<|endoftext|>
|0| Keep away from the cubes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Right.<|endoftext|>
|0| What are you grinning about?<|endoftext|>
|1| We're wanted at the Tower of London.<|endoftext|>
|0| Every cube across the whole world activated at the same moment.<|endoftext|>
|1| Now we're in business. You sent me a message to my psychicpaper. You know what? I'm almost impressed.<|endoftext|>
|0| Secret base beneath the Tower. Hope we're nothere because we know too much.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, I've got officers trained in beheading. Also ravens ofdeath.<|endoftext|>
|0| I like her.<|endoftext|>
|0| There are fifty being monitored, and more coming in all the time.I don't know how useful it is. Every cube is behaving individually.There's no meaningful pattern. Some respond to proximity. Some createmood swings.<|endoftext|>
|0| Er, what's this one?<|endoftext|>
|0| Try the door.<|endoftext|>
|0| On a loop!<|endoftext|>
|0| This is the latest.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh dear. Systems breach at the Pentagon, China, every Africannation, the Middle East.<|endoftext|>
|0| I've got governments screaming for explanations and no idea whatto tell them. I'm lost, Doctor. We all are.<|endoftext|>
|1| Don't despair, Kate. Your dad never did. Kate Stewart, headingup UNIT, changing the way they work. How could you not be? Why did youdrop Lethbridge?<|endoftext|>
|0| I didn't want any favours. Though he guided me, even to the end.Science leads, he always told me. Said he'd learned that from an oldfriend.<|endoftext|>
|1| We don't let him down. We don't let this planet down.<|endoftext|>
|0| They've stopped. The cubes, across the world, they justshut down.<|endoftext|>
|0| Active for forty seven minutes, and then they just die?<|endoftext|>
|1| Not dead. Dormant, maybe.<|endoftext|>
|0| Then why shut down?<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't know. I don't know. I need to think. I need some air.Who has an underground base? Terrible ventilation.<|endoftext|>
|1| The moment they arrived, I should have madesure they were collected and burned. That is what I should have done.<|endoftext|>
|0| How? Nobody would have listened.<|endoftext|>
|1| You're thinking of stopping, aren't you? You and Rory.<|endoftext|>
|0| No. I mean, we haven't made a decision.<|endoftext|>
|1| But you're considering it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Maybe. I don't know. We don't know. Well, our lives have changedso much. But there was a time, there were years, when I couldn't livewithout you. When just the whole everyday thing would drive me crazy.But since you dropped us back here, since you gave us this house, youknow, we've built a life. I don't know if I can have both.<|endoftext|>
|1| Why?<|endoftext|>
|0| Because they pull at each other. Because they pull at me, andbecause the travelling is starting to feel like running away.<|endoftext|>
|1| That's not what it is.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, come on. Look at you, four days in a lounge and you go crazy.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm not running away. But this is one corner of one country inone continent on one planet that's a corner of a galaxy that's a cornerof a universe that is forever growing and shrinking and creating anddestroying and never remaining the same for a single millisecond. Andthere is so much, so much to see, Amy. Because it goes so fast. I'm notrunning away from things, I am running to them before they flare andfade forever. And it's all right. Our lives won't run the same. Theycan't. One day, soon maybe, you'll stop. I've known for a while.<|endoftext|>
|0| Then why do you keep coming back for us?<|endoftext|>
|1| Because you were the first. The first face this face saw. Andyou're seared onto my hearts, Amelia Pond. You always will be. I'mrunning to you, and Rory, before you fade from me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't be nice to me. I don't want you to be nice to me.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, you do, Pond, and you always get what you want. They gotwhat they wanted.<|endoftext|>
|0| What? Who did?<|endoftext|>
|1| The cubes. That's why they stopped. Come on.<|endoftext|>
|1| Kate? Before they shut down, they scannedeverything, from your medical limits to your military responsepatterns. They made a complete assessment of Planet Earth and itsinhabitants. That's what the surge of activity was.<|endoftext|>
|1| Problem with the power?<|endoftext|>
|0| Not possible. We've got back-ups.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hmm.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor? Look.<|endoftext|>
|1| What?<|endoftext|>
|0| Why do they all say seven?<|endoftext|>
|1| Seven. Seven, what's important about seven? Seven wonders ofthe world, seven streams of the River Ota, seven sides of a cube.<|endoftext|>
|0| A cube has six sides.<|endoftext|>
|1| Not if you count the inside.<|endoftext|>
|1| It has to be a countdown.<|endoftext|>
|0| Not in minutes.<|endoftext|>
|1| Why would it be minutes? Kate, we have to get humanity awayfrom those cubes. God knows what they'll do if they hit zero. Get theinformation out any way you can. News channels, websites, radio, textmessages. People have to know that the cubes are dangerous.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, but why is this starting now? I mean, the cubes arrivedmonths ago. Why wait this long?<|endoftext|>
|1| Because they're clever. Allow people enough time to collectthem, take them into their homes, their lives. Humans, the great earlyadopters. And then, wham! Profile every inch of Earth's existence.<|endoftext|>
|0| Discover how best to attack us.<|endoftext|>
|1| Get that information out any way you can. Go!<|endoftext|>
|0| Right.<|endoftext|>
|1| Every cube was activated. There must be signals, energyfluctuations on a colossal scale, there must be some trace. There can'tnot be. We need to think of all the variables, all the possibilities,okay? Go, go, go, go, go!<|endoftext|>
|0| This is a national security alert. The Governmentadvises that members of the public dispose of all cubes. If there arecubes inside your house, remove them immediately.<|endoftext|>
|0| We've get them out of the building. Away fromhere, as far as you can, and get back here before it hits zero. Dad,could you go and get me a box of tape for dressings? It's just thecupboard round the corner.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, boss.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry. Er, excuse me? I'm looking for the supplies cupboard. Isaid, I'm looking for the supplies cupboard.<|endoftext|>
|0| Have you seen my dad?<|endoftext|>
|0| No, sorry.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hey. Dad! Hey! Hey!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, please. You don't have to do this.<|endoftext|>
|0| She's right. You don't have to be in there. We can do thisremotely.<|endoftext|>
|1| Remotely isn't my style. See you after.<|endoftext|>
|1| Geronimo.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's happening?<|endoftext|>
|0| Well? What's in there?<|endoftext|>
|1| There is nothing in here.<|endoftext|>
|0| Er, well, that's good. It's not, it's not bombs, it's not aliens.<|endoftext|>
|1| Why? Why is there nothing inside? Why? It doesn't make anysense.<|endoftext|>
|1| Glasses, is it the same? Is it the same all around the world?<|endoftext|>
|0| They're empty. We're safe, right?<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah, no, no, no, we are very far from safe. All along, everyaction has been deliberate. Why draw attention to the cubes if theydon't contain anything?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, look.<|endoftext|>
|0| They're CCTV feeds from across the world. They're showingthe same.<|endoftext|>
|0| People are dying.<|endoftext|>
|1| What? They can't be dying. How? How are they dying?<|endoftext|>
|0| I want information on how people are being affected.<|endoftext|>
|1| The cubes brought people close together. They opened and thenargh!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, what's the matter?<|endoftext|>
|1| Argh. Ah, I don't know!<|endoftext|>
|0| Hospitals are logging a global surge in heart failures.Cardiac arrests.<|endoftext|>
|1| That's it. Oh! Oh! Oh! Only one heart. Other one's not working.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, I'm going to get you to the hospital!<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, no, no, no, no. Just a short circuit. Turn around, turnaround. Tell me, show me. Ten seconds after the cubes opened, show methe patterns in their electrical currents.<|endoftext|>
|1| See?<|endoftext|>
|0| No!<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, the power cut. They zapped the power and then argh!They're signal boxes. People leaning in, wham. Pure electrical surgeout of the cube targeted at the nearest human heart. The heart, anorgan powered by electrical currents, short-circuited. How to destroy ahuman? Go for the heart. Ow.Crikey Moses.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, the scan you set running. The transmitter locations. It'sfound them.<|endoftext|>
|1| And look at them all, pulsing bold as brass. Seven of them, allacross the world. Ow! Seven stations, seven minutes. Why is thatimportant? Argh! Ow, ow. How do you people manage? One heart, it ispitiful. A wormhole, bridging two dimensions. Seven of them hitchedonto this planet, but where's the closest one? Glasses, zoom in.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's the hospital where Rory works.<|endoftext|>
|0| Dad. Dad!<|endoftext|>
|0| Just get away from him.<|endoftext|>
|1| How many deaths have been recorded?<|endoftext|>
|0| We don't know. We think it could be a third of the population.<|endoftext|>
|1| Kate, I have to find the wormhole, but the attacks could stillhappen. Tell the world. Tell them how to deal with this. The worldneeds your leadership right now.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'll do my best.<|endoftext|>
|1| Of course you will. Good luck, Kate. Argh! Argh!<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, how long are you going to last with only one heart?<|endoftext|>
|1| Not much longer. I need to locate the wormhole portal.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hello. Hello!<|endoftext|>
|1| You are giving off some very strange signals.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, my God.<|endoftext|>
|1| Outlier droid, monitoring everything. If I shut her down, Ican.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah. It's all right, it's all right. Ican't, Amy. I can't do it. I need both hearts!<|endoftext|>
|0| All right. Desperate measures.<|endoftext|>
|1| What? No. No, no, no. That won't work. I'm a Time Lord.<|endoftext|>
|0| All right, clear!<|endoftext|>
|1| Whoo! Ooo. Ooo! Welcome back, lefty! Whoa-ho! Two hearts! Woo!Back in the game. Ah. Never do that to me again.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ah, portal to another dimension in a goods lift?<|endoftext|>
|1| The energy signals converge here. Does seem a bit cramped,though.<|endoftext|>
|1| Through the looking glass, Amelia?<|endoftext|>
|0| Where are we?<|endoftext|>
|1| We're in orbit. One dimension to the left.<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory!<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah. Soborian smelling salts. Outlawed in seven galaxies.<|endoftext|>
|1| Whoa! Whoa! What kind of a welcome do you call that? Get themout of here. You too. Now!<|endoftext|>
|0| What are you going to do?<|endoftext|>
|1| Absolutely no idea. Get him to the portal.<|endoftext|>
|1| Whoa!<|endoftext|>
|0| So many of them crawling the planet, seeping into every corner.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's not possible. I thought the Shakri were a myth. A myth tokeep the young of Gallifrey in their place.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Shakri exist in all of time, and none. We travel alone andtogether. The Seven.<|endoftext|>
|1| The Shakri craft, connected to Earth, through seven portals andseven minutes. Ah, but why?<|endoftext|>
|0| Serving the word of the Tally.<|endoftext|>
|1| Why the cubes? Why Earth?<|endoftext|>
|0| Not Earth, humanity. The Shakri will halt the human plaguebefore the spread.<|endoftext|>
|1| Erase humanity before it colonises space. We thought the cubeswere an invasion. The start of war.<|endoftext|>
|0| The human contagion only must be eliminated.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who are you calling a contagion?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oi! Didn't I tell you two to go?<|endoftext|>
|0| You should have learned by now.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, and what is this Tally anyway?<|endoftext|>
|1| Some people call it Judgment Day, or the Reckoning.<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't you know?<|endoftext|>
|1| I've never wanted to find out.<|endoftext|>
|0| Before the Closure, there is the Tally. The Shakri serves theTally.<|endoftext|>
|1| The pest controllers of the universe, that's how the taleswent, isn't it?<|endoftext|>
|0| Wow. That's some seriously weird bedtime story.<|endoftext|>
|1| You can talk. Wolf in your grandmother's nightdress? So, hereyou are, depositing slug pellets all over the Earth, made attractive sohumans will collect them, hoping to find something beautiful inside.Because that's what they are. Not pests or plague, creatures of hope,forever building and reaching. Making mistakes, of course, every lifeform does. But, but they learn. And they strive for greater, and theyachieve it. You want a tally. Put their achievements against theirfailings through the whole of time, I will back humanity against theShakri every time.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Tally must be met. The second wave will be released.<|endoftext|>
|0| What does that mean?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's going to release more cubes to kill more people.<|endoftext|>
|0| Tell the Secretary General it's not justhospitals and equipment, it's people. Our best hope now is each other.<|endoftext|>
|0| The human plague breeding and fighting. Andwhen cornered, their rage to destroy. You're too late, Doctor. TheTally shall be met.<|endoftext|>
|0| He's gone?<|endoftext|>
|1| He was never really here. Just the ship's automated interface,like a talking propaganda poster. I can stop the second wave. I candisconnect all the Shakri craft from their portals, leave them driftingin the darkspace. Ah, but all those people who were near the cubes, somany of them will have died.<|endoftext|>
|0| I restarted one of your hearts.<|endoftext|>
|0| You'd need mass defibrillation.<|endoftext|>
|1| Of course. Ah, beautiful. But, Ponds, Ponds. We are going to goone better than that. The Shakri used the cubes to turn people's heartsoff. Bingo! We're going to use them to turn them back on again.<|endoftext|>
|0| Will that work?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, creatures of hope. Has to.<|endoftext|>
|1| Thirty seconds. Don't let me down, cubes, you're working for menow. Oh dear. All these cubes. There's going to be a terrible wave ofenergy ricocheting around here any second. Run.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm going to miss this.<|endoftext|>
|0| Emergency hospitals and field units are working at full capacityaround the world, as millions of survivors of cardiac arrests arenursed back to health after an unprecedented night across the globe.<|endoftext|>
|0| You, er, you really are as remarkable as Dadsaid.<|endoftext|>
|0| Thank you.<|endoftext|>
|1| My! A kiss from a Lethbridge Stewart. That is new. Oh dear, I'mlate for dinner.<|endoftext|>
|1| Dear me. I'd better get going. Things to do, worlds to save,swings to swing on. Look, I know, you both have lives here. Beautiful,messy lives. That is what makes you so fabulously human. You don't wantto give them up. I understand.<|endoftext|>
|0| Actually, it's you they can't give up, Doctor. And I don't thinkthey should. Go with him. Go save every world you can find. Who elsehas that chance? Life will still be here.<|endoftext|>
|1| You could come, Brian.<|endoftext|>
|0| Somebody's got to water the plants. Just bring them back safe.<|endoftext|>
|0| So that was the year of the slow invasion, when the Earth gotcubed, and the Doctor came to stay. It was also when we realisedsomething the Shakri never understood. What cubed actually means. Thepower of three.<|endoftext|>
|0| So, will you take the case, Mister Garner?<|endoftext|>
|0| Sure. Why not?<|endoftext|>
|0| Because you don't believe me.<|endoftext|>
|0| For twenty five dollars a day plus expenses, I'll believe anydamn thing you like.<|endoftext|>
|0| But you don't believe that statues can move. And you're right,Mister Garner. They can't. Of course they can't. When you're looking.<|endoftext|>
|0| Good night, Mister Grayle.<|endoftext|>
|0| The address Grayle gave me was an apartment block nearBattery Park.He said it was where the statues lived. I asked him why he didn't golook himself. He didn't answer.Grayle was the scariest guy I knew. If something scared him, I kindawanted to shake its hand.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello? Hello?<|endoftext|>
|0| What the?<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello? Anyone home?<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello?<|endoftext|>
|0| Who are you?<|endoftext|>
|0| They're coming for you. They're going to send you back.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who's coming? Back where?<|endoftext|>
|0| In time. Back in time. I'm you. I'm you.<|endoftext|>
|0| You gotta be kiddin' me.<|endoftext|>
|0| (singing) Whoa, I'm an alien. I'm a legalalien. I'm an Englishman in New York.<|endoftext|>
|1| (reading) New York growled at my window, but I was ready forit.My stocking seams were straight, my lipstick was combat ready, and Iwas packing cleavage thatcould fell an ox at twenty feet.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, you're doing it again.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm reading!<|endoftext|>
|0| Aloud. Please could you not?<|endoftext|>
|1| There's something different about you, isn't there?<|endoftext|>
|0| What's the book?<|endoftext|>
|1| Melody Malone. She's a private detective in old town New York.<|endoftext|>
|0| She's got ice in her heart and a kiss on her lips, and avulnerable side she keeps well hidden.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, you've read it?<|endoftext|>
|0| You read it. Aloud. And then went yowzah!<|endoftext|>
|0| Only you could fancy someone in a book.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm just reading it. I just like the cover.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ooo, can we see the cover?<|endoftext|>
|1| No, no, I'm busy. It's your hair! Is it your hair?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, shut up. It's the glasses. I'm wearing reading glasses now, onmy nose, see? There you go.<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't like them. They make your eyes look all liney. No,actually, sorry. They're fine. Carry on.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, I'm going to go and get us some more coffee. Who wants morecoffee? Me too. I'll go!<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory, do I have noticeable lines on my eyes now?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| No.<|endoftext|>
|0| You didn't look.<|endoftext|>
|0| I noticed them earlier. Didn't notice them. I specificallyremember not noticing them.<|endoftext|>
|0| You walk among fire pits, Centurion.<|endoftext|>
|0| Do I have to come over there?<|endoftext|>
|0| You can if you like.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, we have company.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'll get a babysitter.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, do you know, it is so humiliating when you do that.<|endoftext|>
|0| Coffee?<|endoftext|>
|0| Coffee.<|endoftext|>
|1| Can I have a go? <|endoftext|>
|0| Read to me.<|endoftext|>
|1| I thought you didn't like my reading aloud.<|endoftext|>
|0| Shut up, and read me a story. Just don't go yowzah.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why did you do that?<|endoftext|>
|1| I always rip out the last page of a book. Then it doesn't haveto end. I hate endings.<|endoftext|>
|1| (reads) As I crossed the street, I saw the thin guy, but hedidn't see me. I guess that's how it began.<|endoftext|>
|1| (reads) I followed the skinny guy for two more blocks before heturned and I could ask exactly what he was doing here.He looked a little scared, so I gave him my best smile and my bluesteyes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Beware the yowzah. Do not, at this point, yowz. Doctor? What didthe skinny guy say?<|endoftext|>
|1| He said, 'I just went to get coffees for the Doctor and Amy.Hello, River.'<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello, Dad.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where am I? How the hell did I get here?<|endoftext|>
|0| I haven't the faintest idea, but you'll probably want to putyour hands up.<|endoftext|>
|0| Melody Malone?<|endoftext|>
|0| You're Melody?<|endoftext|>
|0| Get in.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's River doing in a book? What's Rory doing in a book?<|endoftext|>
|1| He went to get coffee. Pay attention.<|endoftext|>
|0| He went to get coffee and turned up in a book. How does that work?<|endoftext|>
|0| What is going on?<|endoftext|>
|0| Where did you get this book?<|endoftext|>
|1| It was in my jacket.<|endoftext|>
|0| How did it get there?<|endoftext|>
|1| How does anything get there. I've given up asking. Date, date.Does she mention a date? When is this happening?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, hang on. Oh, April 3rd, 1938.<|endoftext|>
|0| You didn't come here in the Tardis,obviously.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why?<|endoftext|>
|0| He couldn't have.<|endoftext|>
|1| Couldn't have? What does she mean? Couldn'thave?<|endoftext|>
|0| This city's full of time distortions. It'd be impossible to landthe Tardis here. Like trying to land a plane in a blizzard. Even Icouldn't do it.<|endoftext|>
|1| Even who couldn't do it?<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't you two fall out, she's only in a book.<|endoftext|>
|1| 1938. Easy one.<|endoftext|>
|0| What was that?<|endoftext|>
|1| 1938. We just bounced off it.<|endoftext|>
|0| So how did you get here?<|endoftext|>
|0| Vortex manipulator. Less bulky than a Tardis. A motorbikethrough traffic. You?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm not sure.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Weeping Angels?<|endoftext|>
|1| It makes sense.<|endoftext|>
|0| It makes what?<|endoftext|>
|1| That's what happened to Rory. That's what the Angels do. It'stheir preferred form of attack. They zap you back in time, let you liveto death.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, we've got a time machine. We can just go and get him.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, tried that, if you've noticed, and we are back where westarted in 2012.<|endoftext|>
|0| We didn't start in a graveyard. What are we doing here?<|endoftext|>
|1| Don't know. Probably causally linked somehow. Doesn't matter.Extractor fans on!<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, we're going to get there somehow. We're in the rest of thebook.<|endoftext|>
|1| Doing what?<|endoftext|>
|0| Page 43, you're going to break something.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm what?<|endoftext|>
|0| (reads) 'Why do you have to break mine', I asked the Doctor. Hefrowned and said, 'Because Amy read it in a book and now I have nochoice.'<|endoftext|>
|1| Stop! No! No! Stop! You can't read ahead. You mustn't. And youcan't do that.<|endoftext|>
|0| But we've already been reading it.<|endoftext|>
|1| Just the stuff that's happening now, in parallel with us.That's as far as we go.<|endoftext|>
|0| But it could help us find Rory.<|endoftext|>
|1| And if you read ahead and find that Rory dies? This isn't anyold future, Amy, it's ours. Once we know what's coming, it's fixed. 0I'm going to break something, because you told me that I'm going to doit. No choice now.<|endoftext|>
|0| Time can be rewritten.<|endoftext|>
|1| Not once you've read it. Once we know what's coming, it'swritten in stone.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ah. Early Qin dynasty, I'd say.<|endoftext|>
|0| Correct. Are you an archaeologist as well as a detective?<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay, landing a plane in a timey wimeyblizzard. I could push through, but if I'm out by a nanosecond, theengines will phase and I'll shatter the planet. I need landing lights.<|endoftext|>
|0| Landing lights?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, I need a signal to lock on to. What did she say? Earlywhat dynasty?<|endoftext|>
|0| Early Qin, just as you say. You're verywell informed.<|endoftext|>
|0| And you're very afraid. That's an awful lot of locks for onedoor.<|endoftext|>
|0| River, I'm translating.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's a gift of the Tardis. It hangs around. <|endoftext|>
|0| This one. Put him somewhere uncomfortable.<|endoftext|>
|0| With the babies, sir?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, why not? Give him to the babies.<|endoftext|>
|0| The lights are out. You'll last longer with these.<|endoftext|>
|0| What do you care?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's funnier.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello?<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah, hello, yes.<|endoftext|>
|1| Special commission from the Emperor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello, sweetie. Let's see, crime boss with a collecting fetish.Whatever you don't let anyone else see has got to be your favourite.Or possibly your girlfriend.<|endoftext|>
|0| So, girlfriend, then.<|endoftext|>
|0| What are you doing?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, you know, texting a boy.<|endoftext|>
|1| Landing lights. We have a signal. Locking on.<|endoftext|>
|0| These things are all over, but people don'tseem to notice. It never moves while you're looking.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, I know how they work.<|endoftext|>
|0| So I understand. Melody Malone, the detective who investigatesAngels.<|endoftext|>
|0| Badly damaged.<|endoftext|>
|0| I wanted to know if it could feel pain.<|endoftext|>
|0| You realise it's screaming? The others can hear. Is that why youneed all the locks?<|endoftext|>
|0| You're going to tell me all about these creatures. And you'regoing to do it quickly.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello, is someone there?<|endoftext|>
|0| Come on, come on.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Angels are predators. They're deadly.What do you want with them?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm a collector. What collector could resist these? I'm onlyhuman.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's exactly what they're thinking.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's that? What's happening? Is it an earthquake?<|endoftext|>
|0| What is it?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, you bad boy. You could burn New York.<|endoftext|>
|0| What does that mean?<|endoftext|>
|0| It means, Mister Grayle, just you wait till my husband getshome.<|endoftext|>
|0| Come on!<|endoftext|>
|1| Just a moment. Final checks.<|endoftext|>
|0| Since when?<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory? Rory? Rory?<|endoftext|>
|1| Sorry I'm late, honey. Traffic was hell. Shock. He'll be fine.<|endoftext|>
|0| Not if I can get loose.<|endoftext|>
|1| So where are we now, Doctor Song? How's prison?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, I was pardoned ages ago. And it's Professor Song to you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Pardoned?<|endoftext|>
|0| Mmm. Turns out the person I killed never existed in the firstplace. Apparently, there's no record of him. It's almost as ifsomeone's gone around deleting himself from every database in theuniverse.<|endoftext|>
|1| You said I got too big.<|endoftext|>
|0| And now no one's ever heard of you. Didn't you used to besomebody?<|endoftext|>
|1| Weren't you the woman who killed the Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor who?<|endoftext|>
|1| She's holding you very tight.<|endoftext|>
|0| At least she didn't send me back in time.<|endoftext|>
|1| I doubt she's strong enough.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, I need a hand back, so which is it going to be? Are yougoing to break my wrist or hers? Oh, no. Really? Why do you have tobreak mine?<|endoftext|>
|1| Because Amy read it in a book, and now I have no choice.<|endoftext|>
|1| You see?<|endoftext|>
|0| What book?<|endoftext|>
|1| Your book. Which you haven't written yet, so we can't read.<|endoftext|>
|0| I see. I don't like the cover much.<|endoftext|>
|0| But if River's going to write that book, she'd make it useful,yeah?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'll certainly try. But we can't read ahead, it's too dangerous.<|endoftext|>
|0| I know, but there must be something we can look at.<|endoftext|>
|1| What, a page of handy hints, previews, spoiler free?<|endoftext|>
|0| Chapter titles.<|endoftext|>
|1| He's in the cellar.<|endoftext|>
|0| Gimme!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor? Doctor, what is it? What's wrong? Tell me. Doctor?Doctor, what is it, tell me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, I know that face. Calm down. Calm down! Talk to me.Doctor! <|endoftext|>
|1| No! Get your wrist out. You get your wrist out without breakingit!<|endoftext|>
|0| How?<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't know. Just do it. Change the future!<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory?<|endoftext|>
|1| No! They're Angels. Baby Angels.<|endoftext|>
|0| Did they get Rory? Where is he? Did they take him?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, I think so, yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| So, is this what's going to happen? We justkeep chasing him and they keep pulling him further back?<|endoftext|>
|0| He isn't back in time. I'm reading a displacement, but there areno temporal markers. He's been moved in space, not in time, and it'snot that far from here by the look of it.<|endoftext|>
|1| You got out.<|endoftext|>
|0| So, where is he?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, come on, come on, come on, where is he?<|endoftext|>
|0| If it was that easy, I'd get you to do it.<|endoftext|>
|1| How did you get your wrist out without breaking it?<|endoftext|>
|0| You asked, I did. Problem?<|endoftext|>
|1| You just changed the future.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's called marriage, honey. Now, hush, I'm working.<|endoftext|>
|1| She's good, have you noticed? Really, really good.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ah, wherever it is, it's within a few blocks. There's a car outfront. Shall we steal it?<|endoftext|>
|1| Show me!<|endoftext|>
|0| Got it.<|endoftext|>
|1| Why did you lie to me?<|endoftext|>
|0| When one's in love with an ageless god who insists on the faceof a twelve year old, one does one's best to hide the damage.<|endoftext|>
|1| It must hurt. Come here.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes. The wrist is pretty bad too.<|endoftext|>
|0| No. No. No, stop that. Stop that. Stop it!<|endoftext|>
|1| There you go. How's that?<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, let's see, shall we?<|endoftext|>
|0| That was a stupid waste of regeneration energy. Nothing isgained by you being a sentimental idiot.<|endoftext|>
|1| River<|endoftext|>
|0| No, you embarrass me.<|endoftext|>
|1| River!<|endoftext|>
|0| Tell you what. Stick to the science part.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, why did you lie?<|endoftext|>
|0| Never let him see the damage. And never, ever let him see youage. He doesn't like endings.<|endoftext|>
|1| There you are.<|endoftext|>
|1| Got it. He's at a place called Winter Quay.The car, yes? Let's go.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why would they send him here? Why not zaphim back in time, like they normally do?<|endoftext|>
|1| We'll know that when we know what this place is.<|endoftext|>
|0| Winter Quay.<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory?<|endoftext|>
|0| He's close.<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory!<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory!<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, look at this. Why is it smiling?<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy. Rory!<|endoftext|>
|1| Get out of here! Don't look at anything.Don't touch<|endoftext|>
|0| Who's that?<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy. Amy, please. Amy, please. Please.<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory? He's you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Will someone please tell me what is going on?<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm sorry, Rory, but you just died.<|endoftext|>
|1| This place is policed by Angels. Every time you try to escape,you get zapped back in time.<|endoftext|>
|0| So this place belongs to the Angels? They built it?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's like they've taken over every statue in the city.<|endoftext|>
|1| The Angels take Manhattan because they can, because they'venever had a food source like this one. The city that never sleeps.(Slow heavy footsteps outside the window.)<|endoftext|>
|0| What was that?<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't know. But I think they're coming for you.<|endoftext|>
|0| What does that mean? What is going to happen to me? What isphysically going to happen?<|endoftext|>
|1| The Angels will come for you. They'll zap you back in time tothis very spot, thirty, forty years ago. And you'll live out the restof your life in this room, until you die in that bed.<|endoftext|>
|0| And will Amy be there?<|endoftext|>
|1| No.<|endoftext|>
|0| How do you know?<|endoftext|>
|1| Because he was so pleased to see you again.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay. Well, they haven't taken me yet. What if I just run? Whatif I just get the hell out of here? Then that never happens.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, he's right.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, he isn't.<|endoftext|>
|0| If Rory got out, it would create a paradox.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is that?<|endoftext|>
|0| This is the Angels' food source. The paradox poisons the well.It could kill them all. This whole place would literally unhappen.<|endoftext|>
|1| It would be almost impossible.<|endoftext|>
|0| Loving the almost.<|endoftext|>
|1| But to create a paradox like that takes almost unimaginablepower. What have we got, eh? Tell me. Come on, what?<|endoftext|>
|0| I won't let them take him. That's what we've got.<|endoftext|>
|0| Whatever that thing is, it's getting closer.<|endoftext|>
|1| Rory, even if you got out, you'd have to keep running for therest of your life. They would be chasing you for ever.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, then. Better get started.<|endoftext|>
|0| Husband, run!<|endoftext|>
|1| River, I'm not sure this can work.<|endoftext|>
|0| Husband, shut up.<|endoftext|>
|0| Up!<|endoftext|>
|0| What good's up?<|endoftext|>
|0| Better than down!<|endoftext|>
|1| We can't keep doing this.<|endoftext|>
|0| Any ideas?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, the usual. Run!<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay! Fire escape.<|endoftext|>
|0| I always wanted to visit the Statue OfLiberty. I guess she got impatient.<|endoftext|>
|0| What? What is it, what?<|endoftext|>
|0| Just keep your eyes on that.<|endoftext|>
|0| Is there a way down?<|endoftext|>
|0| Er, no. But there's a way out.<|endoftext|>
|0| What are you doing? Rory, what are you doing?<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory, stop it. You'll die.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, twice, in the same building on the same night. Who elsecould do that?<|endoftext|>
|0| Just come down, please.<|endoftext|>
|0| This is the right thing to do. This will work. If I die now, it'sa paradox, right? The paradox kills the Angels. Tell me I'm wrong. Goon, please, because I'm really scared. Oh, great. The one time youcan't manage it.Amy, I'm going to need a little help here.<|endoftext|>
|0| Just stop it!<|endoftext|>
|0| Just think it through. This will work, this will kill the Angels.<|endoftext|>
|0| It'll kill you too.<|endoftext|>
|0| Will it? River said that this place would be erased from time,never existed. If this place never existed, what did I fall off?<|endoftext|>
|0| You think you'll come back to life?<|endoftext|>
|0| When don't I?<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory.<|endoftext|>
|0| And anyway, what else is there? Dying of old age downstairs,never seeing you again? Amy, please. If you love me, then trust me, andpush.<|endoftext|>
|0| I can't.<|endoftext|>
|0| You have to!<|endoftext|>
|0| Could you? If it was me, could you do it?<|endoftext|>
|0| To save you, I'd do anything.<|endoftext|>
|0| Prove it.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, I can't take you too.<|endoftext|>
|0| You said we'd come back to life. Money where your mouth is time.<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy, look.<|endoftext|>
|0| Shut up. Together, or not at all.<|endoftext|>
|1| What the hell are you doing!<|endoftext|>
|0| Changing the future. It's called marriage.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy! Amy!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor! What's happening?<|endoftext|>
|1| The paradox. It's working! The paradox is working!<|endoftext|>
|0| Where are we?<|endoftext|>
|1| Back where we started. You collapsed the timeline. The paradoxworked. We all pinged back where we belong.<|endoftext|>
|0| What, in a graveyard?<|endoftext|>
|0| This happened the last time. Why always here?<|endoftext|>
|1| Does it matter? We got lucky. We could've blown New York offthe planet. I can't ever take the Tardis back there. The timelines aretoo scrambled. I could have lost you both. Don't ever do that again.<|endoftext|>
|0| What did we do? We fixed it. We solved the problem.<|endoftext|>
|1| I was talking to myself.<|endoftext|>
|0| It could do with a repaint.<|endoftext|>
|1| I've been busy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Does the bulb on top need changing?<|endoftext|>
|1| I just changed it.<|endoftext|>
|0| So. Rory and Amy, then.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes. I know, I know.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm just saying. They're going to get terribly bored hanginground here all day.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ha!<|endoftext|>
|0| Look, next time, could we could just go to the pub?<|endoftext|>
|1| I want go to the pub right now. Are there video games there? Ilove video games.<|endoftext|>
|0| Right. Family outing, then.<|endoftext|>
|0| Amy, come and see this.<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|0| There's a gravestone here for someone with the same name as me.<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|0| Where the hell did that come from?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's a survivor. Very weak, but keep your eyes on it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where's Rory?<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm sorry. Amelia, I'm so, so sorry.<|endoftext|>
|0| No. No, we can just go and get him in the Tardis. One moreparadox.<|endoftext|>
|1| Would rip New York apart.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, that's not true. I don't believe you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Mother, it's true.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy, what are you doing?<|endoftext|>
|0| That gravestone, Rory's, there's room for one more name, isn'tthere?<|endoftext|>
|1| What are you talking about? Back away from the Angel. Come backto the Tardis. We'll figure something out.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Angel, would it send me back to the same time? To him?<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't know. Nobody knows.<|endoftext|>
|0| But it's my best shot, yeah?<|endoftext|>
|1| No!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, shut up. Yes. Yes, it is.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, then. I just have to blink, right?<|endoftext|>
|1| No!<|endoftext|>
|0| It'll be fine. I know it will. I'll be with him, like I should be.Me and Rory together. Melody?<|endoftext|>
|1| Stop it. Just, just stop it!<|endoftext|>
|0| You look after him. You be a good girl, and you look after him.<|endoftext|>
|1| You are creating fixed time. I will never be able to see youagain.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'll be fine. I'll be with him.<|endoftext|>
|1| Amy, please, just come back into the Tardis. Come along, Pond,please.<|endoftext|>
|0| Raggedy man, goodbye!<|endoftext|>
|1| No!<|endoftext|>
|1| River, they were your parents. I'm sorry, I didn't think.<|endoftext|>
|0| It doesn't matter.<|endoftext|>
|1| Of course it matters.<|endoftext|>
|0| What matters is this. Doctor, don't travel alone.<|endoftext|>
|1| Travel with me, then.<|endoftext|>
|0| Whenever and wherever you want. But not all the time. Onepsychopath per Tardis, don't you think? Okay. This book I've got towrite. Melody Malone. I presume I send it to Amy to get it published?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes. Yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'll tell her to write an afterword. For you. Maybe you'lllisten to her.<|endoftext|>
|1| The last page!<|endoftext|>
|0| Afterword, by Amelia Williams. Hello, old friend. And here weare, you and me, on the last page.By the time you read these words, Rory and I will be long gone. So knowthat we lived well, and were very happy. And above all else, know thatwe will love you always. Sometimes I do worry about you, though. Ithink once we're gone, you won't be coming back here for a while, andyou might be alone, which you should never be. Don't be alone, Doctor.And do one more thing for me. There's a little girl waiting in agarden. She's going to wait a long while, so she's going to need a lotof hope. Go to her. Tell her a story. Tell her that if she's patient,the days are coming that she'll never forget. Tell her she'll go to seaand fight pirates. She'll fall in love with a man who'll wait twothousand years to keep her safe. Tell her she'll give hope to thegreatest painter who ever lived and save a whale in outer space. Tellher this is the story of Amelia Pond. And this how it ends.<|endoftext|>
|1| I know. You both have lives here. Beautiful, messy lives. Thatis what makes you so fabulously human. You don't want to give them up.I understand.<|endoftext|>
|0|  Actually, it's you they can't give up, Doctor. And Idon't think they should. Go with him. Go save every world you can find.Who else has that chance? Life will still be here.<|endoftext|>
|1| You could come, Brian.<|endoftext|>
|0| Somebody's got to water the plants.<|endoftext|>
|0| Rory & Amy's house/hall -sunset].<|endoftext|>
|0| Mr Brian Williams?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes. How did you know I was here? This isn't my house.<|endoftext|>
|0| This is for you.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't understand.<|endoftext|>
|0| You should read it. I'll wait.<|endoftext|>
|0|  Dear Dad. This is the difficult bit. If I've gotthis right, you're reading this letter a week after we left in theTardis. Er, the thing is, we're not coming back. We're alive and well,and stuck in New York, fifty years before I was born. We can't comehome again. I won't ever see you again, and that breaks my heart. I'mso sorry, Dad. I thought about this for years, and I realised there wasone thing I could do. I could write to you. Tell you everything abouthow we lived. How despite it all, we were happy. But before I do, Ineed you to know, you are the best dad any son could've had, and forall of the times I've drove you mad, and you drove me mad, all thetimes I snapped at you, I'm sorry. I miss everything about you.Especially our awkward hugs. I bought a trowel! We have a small yard. Igarden.<|endoftext|>
|0| But one more important bit of business. The man whodelivered the letter... Anthony. Be nice to him, because he's yourgrandson.<|endoftext|>
|0| We finally adopted in 1946. Anthony Brian Williams.He can tell you everything. He'll have the family albums, and I realisehaving a grandson who's older than you is so far beyond weird, but I'msorry. I love you, Dad. I miss you.<|endoftext|>
|0| How d'you do, sir?<|endoftext|>
|0| In London in the time of Queen Victoria, there were manytales of a remarkable personage known as the Great Detective. I refer,of course, to Madame Vastra, the lizard woman of Paternoster Row andher extraordinary adventures, her beautiful assistant, Jenny Flint, andtheir mysterious henchman, Strax, whose countenance was too abominableto be photographed. There are also accounts of a fourth member of thePaternoster Gang, a shadowy figure whose assistance was only sought inthe direst emergencies.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm so glad you came. We have news, I think, of particularinterest to you. There was a meteor shower in the southwest, unexpectedtiming and density. I've calculated there is a thirty four percentchance it is the result of alien intervention. Twenty four percent.Well, they could just be meteors but it is worth looking in to. Thereis a very pleasant tea room in the area.<|endoftext|>
|0| Also, there's a Professor Arasmus Pink who's claiming he's goingto split the world open with a giant drill through the thinnest part ofthe Earth's crust. I think we should investigate. I mean, he doesn'tactually have a giant drill, and he's not really a professor, and hewas a bit drunk at the time and singing a bit, but you know it is nevertoo early to investigate a drill.<|endoftext|>
|0| I've declared war on the moon.<|endoftext|>
|0| Do be quiet, Strax.<|endoftext|>
|0| Too long the moon has hung unmonitored and unsuspected in thesky. It has gained an enormous tactical advantage.<|endoftext|>
|0| There's no one living there.<|endoftext|>
|0| Then it is clearly time to act. They won't suspect a thing.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who won't suspect a thing?<|endoftext|>
|0| Moonites.<|endoftext|>
|1| Why do you keep doing this? What is the point? I have told you.I keep telling you, I don't do this any more. I've retired.<|endoftext|>
|0| There's a man on Praed Street with an invisible wife. Maybe hejust doesn't have a wife.<|endoftext|>
|1| You're wasting my time.<|endoftext|>
|0| Merry Christmas!<|endoftext|>
|0| I think he means it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, my dear, I rather think he does.<|endoftext|>
|0| Damn moon.<|endoftext|>
|0| Prepare for obliteration, Earthling scum.<|endoftext|>
|0| Actually, Mister Strax, if you could just take him aside fora moment, I have some officers on the way.<|endoftext|>
|0| As you wish. Humans.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry. He is new.<|endoftext|>
|0| Funny looking fellow but, Turkish, is he?<|endoftext|>
|0| He is a genetically modified clone warrior from outer space.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ah. Makes sense. Well, what a case. Identical twins, poisonundetectable to science, an ancient Egyptian curse. Once more ScotlandYard is in your debt, Madame Vastra. Where would we be without you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Quite some distance from a clue, one imagines.<|endoftext|>
|0| You might be right. Does it ever hurt?<|endoftext|>
|0| Does what hurt?<|endoftext|>
|0| Your skin condition. Always wondered.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's not a condition, Inspector. It's just skin.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you sure?<|endoftext|>
|0| I am, as I may have failed to mention, an intelligent reptilefrom an ancient civilisation long preceding mankind. Many of us slumberunder the Earth's crust.<|endoftext|>
|0| Madame was accidentally awoken by an extension to the LondonUnderground.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, that would account for it.<|endoftext|>
|0| I was not initially keen on the society of apes, but I made themost elementary of errors. I fell in love.<|endoftext|>
|0| What, with the Turkish fellow?<|endoftext|>
|0| No. Not with the Turkish fellow.<|endoftext|>
|0| Good lord. Good lord.<|endoftext|>
|0| Come along, my dear.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, my darling.<|endoftext|>
|0| Good lord.<|endoftext|>
|0| Still no word from the Doctor, then?<|endoftext|>
|0| No, my dear. And there won't be.<|endoftext|>
|0| He can't sulk in his box forever.<|endoftext|>
|0| Heartbreak is a burden to us all. Pity the man with two.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's starting to snow.<|endoftext|>
|0| But it can't be.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, it is nearly Christmas.<|endoftext|>
|0| But the clouds.<|endoftext|>
|0| What about them?<|endoftext|>
|0| There aren't any. <|endoftext|>
|0| Walter, don't you want to go and play with the other boys andgirls? They're very nice.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't need anyone else.<|endoftext|>
|0| He never talks to anyone. He's so alone. It's not right. It'snot healthy.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't want to talk to them. They're silly.<|endoftext|>
|0| They're silly. Don't talk to them. They're silly.<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't need anyone else. I can help you.<|endoftext|>
|0| How?<|endoftext|>
|0| The last of the arrivals have been sampled.<|endoftext|>
|0| The great swarm is approaching. As humanity celebrates, soshall it end. Will the final piece be ready?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's in hand. I serve you in this, as in everything else.<|endoftext|>
|0| And do you keep my secrets, those men who helped us tonight?<|endoftext|>
|0| It won't be a problem. I promised to feed them.<|endoftext|>
|0| Beg pardon, Doctor Simeon. It's been a long day. I don't seeany food here.<|endoftext|>
|0| I do.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is this?<|endoftext|>
|0| I said I'd feed you. I didn't say who to.<|endoftext|>
|0| Did you make this snowman?<|endoftext|>
|1| No.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, who did? Because it wasn't there a second ago. It justappeared, from nowhere.<|endoftext|>
|1| Maybe it's snow that fell before. Maybe it remembers how tomake snowmen.<|endoftext|>
|0| What, snow that can remember? That's silly.<|endoftext|>
|1| What's wrong with silly?<|endoftext|>
|0| Nothing. Still talking to you, ain't I?<|endoftext|>
|1| What's your name?<|endoftext|>
|0| Clara.<|endoftext|>
|1| Nice name. Clara. You should definitely keep it. Goodbye!<|endoftext|>
|0| Oi! Where are you going? I thought we was just gettingacquainted.<|endoftext|>
|0| How refreshing to see you taking aninterest again. Was she nice?<|endoftext|>
|1| I just spoke to her.<|endoftext|>
|0| And made your usual impact, no doubt.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, no impact at all. Those days are over.<|endoftext|>
|0| You can't help yourself.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's the same story every time. And italways begins with the same two words.<|endoftext|>
|1| She'll never be able to find me again. Shedoesn't even have the name. Doctor. What two words?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor? Doctor who?<|endoftext|>
|0| Good evening, sir.<|endoftext|>
|0| Pond's frozen over. Hasn't frozen since the night<|endoftext|>
|0| Since the night your children's governess died, a year ago.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor Simeon, sir. He insisted on waiting.<|endoftext|>
|0| She drowned in this very pond.<|endoftext|>
|0| Which then froze. You didn't find her till a month later, whenthe ice finally melted.<|endoftext|>
|0| I recall the incident. It is the sort of thing one remembers.<|endoftext|>
|0| The ice remembers too.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who are you? What do you want here?<|endoftext|>
|0| The pond is yours, Captain Latimer, but what is growing insideit, when it is ready, is ours. Good evening.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, Doctor Simeon, you're out very late tonight.<|endoftext|>
|0| Almost makes you wonder what you've been up to. But then, Ihave often wondered about the activities of Doctor Simeon and hisexceptionally secretive Institute.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, I am honoured this evening. The veiled detective and herfatuous accomplice.<|endoftext|>
|0| At your service.<|endoftext|>
|0| You realise Doctor Doyle is almost certainly basing hisfantastical tales on your own exploits? With a few choice alterations,of course.I doubt the readers of The Strand magazine would accept that the greatdetective is, in reality a woman.<|endoftext|>
|0| And her suspiciously intimate companion<|endoftext|>
|0| I resent your implication of impropriety. We are married.<|endoftext|>
|0| More than can be said for you, eh, dear?<|endoftext|>
|0| Now then. This snow is interesting, don't you think? The icecrystals seem to have a low level telepathic field. Almost as if it candetect and respond to the thoughts and memories of the people aroundit. Memory snow. Snow that learns.<|endoftext|>
|0| How fascinating.<|endoftext|>
|0| I hope it's listening to the right people. It could be aterrible weapon in the wrong hands, don't you think?<|endoftext|>
|0| I think winter is coming. Such a winter as this world has neverknown. The last winter of humankind. Do you know why I'm telling youall this?<|endoftext|>
|0| I am intrigued.<|endoftext|>
|0| Because there's not a single thing you can do to stop it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Perhaps I can't, but I know a man who can.<|endoftext|>
|0| I look forward to meeting him.<|endoftext|>
|0| Do you mean the Doctor? He won't help us. He never helps anymore, you know that.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, my dear, I do. So pray for a miracle, because I think weare going to need him.<|endoftext|>
|0| They've taken samples from snowmen all over London. What do yousuppose they're doing in there?<|endoftext|>
|1| This snow is new. Possibly alien. When you find something brandnew in the world, something you've never seen before, what's the nextthing you look for?<|endoftext|>
|0| A grenade.<|endoftext|>
|1| A profit. That's Victorian values for you.<|endoftext|>
|0| I suggest a full frontal assault with automated laser monkeys,scalpel mines and acid.<|endoftext|>
|1| Why?<|endoftext|>
|0| Couldn't we at least investigate?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's none of our business.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sir, permission to express my opposition to your current apathy?<|endoftext|>
|1| Permission granted.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sir, I am opposed to your current apathy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Let me out!<|endoftext|>
|1| Thank you, Strax. And if ever I'm in need of advice from apsychotic potato dwarf, you'll certainly be the first to know.<|endoftext|>
|0| But if the snow is new and alien, shouldn't we be making someattempt to destroy it? Be reasonable.<|endoftext|>
|1| It is not our problem. Over a thousand years of saving theuniverse, Strax, you know the one thing I learned? The universe doesn'tcare.<|endoftext|>
|0| In this cab. Oi, Doctor! Let me out! Are you listening tome?<|endoftext|>
|1| Now, we have a problem of our own to worry about.<|endoftext|>
|0| Let me out!<|endoftext|>
|0| Oi!<|endoftext|>
|1| Don't worry. No one's going to hurt you.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is that thing?<|endoftext|>
|0| Silence, boy!<|endoftext|>
|1| That's Strax. And as you can see, he's easily confused.<|endoftext|>
|0| Silence, girl. Sorry, lad.<|endoftext|>
|1| Sontaran. Clone warrior race. Factory produced, whole legionsat a time. Two genders is a bit further than he can count.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sir, do not discuss my reproductive cycle in front of enemygirls. It's embarrassing.<|endoftext|>
|1| Typical middle child of six million.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who are you?<|endoftext|>
|1| It doesn't matter because you're about to forget that you and Iever met.<|endoftext|>
|0| We'll need the worm.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sir.<|endoftext|>
|0| You'll need the what? The worm? What worm?<|endoftext|>
|1| Don't worry, it won't hurt, but one touch on your bare skin andyou lose the last hour of your memory.<|endoftext|>
|1| Where is it?<|endoftext|>
|0| Where's what, sir?<|endoftext|>
|1| I sent you to get the memory worm.<|endoftext|>
|0| Did you? When? Who's he? What are we doing here? Look, it's beensnowing!<|endoftext|>
|1| You didn't use the gauntlets, did you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Why would I need the gauntlets? Do you want me to get the memoryworm?<|endoftext|>
|1| You.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, can you see it?<|endoftext|>
|0| I think I can hear it.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oi, don't try to run away. Stay where you are.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why would I run? I know what's going to happen next and it'sfunny.<|endoftext|>
|1| What's funny?<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, your little pal, for a start. He's an ugly little fella,isn't he?<|endoftext|>
|1| Maybe. He gave his life for a friend of mine once.<|endoftext|>
|0| Then how come he's alive?<|endoftext|>
|1| Another friend of mine brought him back. I'm not sure all hisbrains made the return trip!<|endoftext|>
|0| Neither am I.<|endoftext|>
|0| I can see it.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ooo! Can you reach it? Have you got it?<|endoftext|>
|0| Got what, sir?<|endoftext|>
|0| Because these are the gauntlets, aren't they?<|endoftext|>
|0| Sir, emergency! I think I've been run over by a cab.<|endoftext|>
|1| There you go. One touch and you lose about an hour of yourmemory. Let it bite you and you could lose decades.<|endoftext|>
|1| And you're still not trying to run.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't understand how the snowman built itself. I'll run onceyou've explained.<|endoftext|>
|1| Clara who?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor who?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, dangerous question.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's wrong with dangerous?<|endoftext|>
|1| The snow emits a low level telepathic field.<|endoftext|>
|0| My snowman.<|endoftext|>
|1| It seems to reflect people's thoughts and memories and becauseit's unusual, somehow it carries a previous shape and<|endoftext|>
|0| No, Doctor. My snowman.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah! Interesting. Well, were you thinking about it?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, stop. Clara, stop thinking about the snowmen!<|endoftext|>
|1| Get down! Clara, listen to me. The snow's feeding off yourthoughts.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't understand.<|endoftext|>
|1| You're caught in their telepathic field. They're mirroring you.The more you think about the snowmen, the more they appear. Imaginethem melting. Picture it. Picture them melted!<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, very good. Very, very good. Ha!<|endoftext|>
|0| Is that going to happen again?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, if it does, you know what to do about it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Unless I forget.<|endoftext|>
|1| Don't come looking for me. Forget about me. You understand?<|endoftext|>
|0| What about the snow? Shouldn't we be warning people?<|endoftext|>
|1| Not my problem. Merry Christmas. Take her back where we foundher.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sir.<|endoftext|>
|0| Come on.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello. Invisible.<|endoftext|>
|0| An invisible staircase.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hello? Hello? Hello?<|endoftext|>
|0| Tonight the thaw. Tomorrow the snow will fall again, yetstronger. The drowned woman and the dreaming child will give us form atlast.Tomorrow the snow will fall and so shall mankind. She is coming.<|endoftext|>
|0| Look at that. Must have thawed in the night.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm begging you, Clara. I'm on my knees.<|endoftext|>
|0| Elsie is back this afternoon, and I was only helping out. I'vegot my own work to get back to.<|endoftext|>
|0| What work? Why won't you ever tell us?<|endoftext|>
|0| You'd never believe me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Alice, how smart you look today.<|endoftext|>
|0| The governess should enter by the back door, unless accompaniedby the children.<|endoftext|>
|0| And how are the children? Excited about tomorrow?<|endoftext|>
|0| Francesca, same as ever. Digby says he missed you every day.Captain Latimer wants to see you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Of course. Every day?<|endoftext|>
|0| Twice on Saturdays.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's better.<|endoftext|>
|0| Captain Latimer.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ah. Miss Montague, you're back.<|endoftext|>
|0| In time for Christmas. Apologies for my brief absence. Familyillness is so unpredictable. You wanted to see me?<|endoftext|>
|0| Francesca has been having nightmares.<|endoftext|>
|0| Young girls often do.<|endoftext|>
|0| Every night this week, she says. Won't tell me about them.<|endoftext|>
|0| Perhaps if you asked her in the right way, there's no one she'drather tell.<|endoftext|>
|0| Children are not really my area of expertise.<|endoftext|>
|0| They are, however, your children.<|endoftext|>
|0| You have, if I may say, a remarkable amount of wisdom in thesematters, for one so very pretty, Miss Montague. Young, I mean.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'll see to the children now.<|endoftext|>
|0| Miss Montague!<|endoftext|>
|0| Miss Montague, you're back!<|endoftext|>
|0| Ah, ah, ah!<|endoftext|>
|0| Good morning, Miss Montague.<|endoftext|>
|0| Good morning, Miss Montague.<|endoftext|>
|0| Good morning, Francesca. Good morning, Digby. Christmas Eve isthe most thrilling day, don't you think? Now, what have you two been upto while I've been away?<|endoftext|>
|0| I did seven drawings and we saw a dead cow.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, how exciting.<|endoftext|>
|0| Do your secret voice.<|endoftext|>
|0| Allo, mates.<|endoftext|>
|0| They're not exactly nightmares. Just dreams.<|endoftext|>
|0| About our old governess. The one who died. She's hauntingFrannie from beyond the grave.<|endoftext|>
|0| Haven't you spoken to your father about this?<|endoftext|>
|0| You can't talk about things like that to Daddy.<|endoftext|>
|0| You could try.<|endoftext|>
|0| Do you want to see where she died?<|endoftext|>
|0| She fell in there, and then it froze. She was in the ice fordays and days. I hated her. She was cross all the time. In Frannie'sdream she's still down there, waiting to come back.<|endoftext|>
|0| Everything else has thawed, but this pond is still frozen.<|endoftext|>
|0| The snow is feeding off your thoughts. The more youthink about the snowmen, the more they appear.<|endoftext|>
|0| Frannie, this is important. You dream about her. What do youdream?<|endoftext|>
|0| She's cross with me. She says I've been bad, and she's goingto come out of the pond and punish me.<|endoftext|>
|0| When?<|endoftext|>
|0| She said she'd come back for Christmas. Tonight.<|endoftext|>
|0| I think Frannie's gone mad, don't you? I think she needs adoctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor! Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|0| What's she looking at?<|endoftext|>
|0| She's asking for a doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|0| Now then, that's enough noise. We don't want to attractattention, do we?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm looking for the Doctor. Do you know about him? The Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor who?<|endoftext|>
|0| Do not attempt to escape or you will beobliterated! May I take your coat?<|endoftext|>
|0| Sit.<|endoftext|>
|0| There are two refreshments in your world the colour of redwine. This is not red wine.<|endoftext|>
|0| Madame Vastra will ask you questions. You will confine yourselfto single word responses. One word only, do you understand?<|endoftext|>
|0| Why?<|endoftext|>
|0| Truth is singular. Lies are words, words, words. You met theDoctor, didn't you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| And now you've come looking for him again. Why?<|endoftext|>
|0| Take your time. One word only.<|endoftext|>
|0| Curiosity.<|endoftext|>
|0| About?<|endoftext|>
|0| Snow.<|endoftext|>
|0| And about him?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| What do you want from him?<|endoftext|>
|0| Help.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why?<|endoftext|>
|0| Danger.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why would he help you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Kindness.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Doctor is not kind.<|endoftext|>
|0| No?<|endoftext|>
|0| No. The Doctor doesn't help people. Not anyone, not ever. Hestands above this world and doesn't interfere in the affairs of itsinhabitants.He is not your salvation, nor your protector. Do you understand what Iam saying to you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Words.<|endoftext|>
|0| He was different once, a long time ago. Kind, yes. A hero,even. A saver of worlds. But he suffered losses which hurt him.Now he prefers isolation to the possibility of pain's return. Kindlychoose a word to indicate your understanding of this.<|endoftext|>
|0| Man.<|endoftext|>
|0| We are the Doctor's friends. We assist him in his isolation butthat does not mean we approve of it. So, a test for you. Give me amessage for the Doctor. Tell him all about the snow and what freshdanger you believe it presents, and above all, explain why he shouldhelp you. But do it in one word. You're thinking it is impossible thatsuch a word exists, or that you could even find it.Let's see if the gods are with you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes? What? I'm trying to read.<|endoftext|>
|0| Miss Clara and her concerns about the snow.<|endoftext|>
|0| I gave her the one word test.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's always pointless. What did she say? Well? Well?<|endoftext|>
|0| Pond.<|endoftext|>
|0| Strax has already suggested where tostart investigating.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's wrong?<|endoftext|>
|0| There is danger here. An intelligence. An intelligence beyondanything else in this time and place.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor Simeon, sir. There's someone demanding to see you.<|endoftext|>
|0| No callers, not in here, not ever. Did he leave his name?<|endoftext|>
|0| Sir, it's Sherlock Holmes.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, nice office. Big globey thing. Now, shut up, don't tell me!I see from your collar stud you have an apple tree and a wife with alimp. Am I right?<|endoftext|>
|0| No.<|endoftext|>
|1| Do you have a wife?<|endoftext|>
|0| No.<|endoftext|>
|1| Bit of a tree? Bit of a wife? Some apples? Come on, work withme here.<|endoftext|>
|0| I enjoy The Strand magazine as much as the next man, but I amperfectly aware that Sherlock Holmes is a fictional character. Get out!<|endoftext|>
|1| Do you have a goldfish named Colin?<|endoftext|>
|0| No.<|endoftext|>
|1| Thought not. Now, ooo. I see this is one of your businesscards. It says so on the front.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who are you, and What are you doing here?<|endoftext|>
|1| This. Wakey, wakey!<|endoftext|>
|0| That is highly valuable equipment. You must step away now.<|endoftext|>
|0| We are the Intelligence.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ooo. Talking snow. I love new things.<|endoftext|>
|0| You are not of this world.<|endoftext|>
|1| Takes one to snow one. Right, let's see. Multi-nucleatecrystalline organism with the ability to mimic and mirror what itfinds. Looks like snow. Isn't snow.<|endoftext|>
|0| You must leave here now.<|endoftext|>
|1| Shut up, I'm making deductions. It's very exciting. Now, whatare you, eh? A flock of space crystals? A swarm? The snowmen are footsoldiers,mindless predators. But you, you're the clever one. You're Moriarty.So, you turn up on a planet, you generate a telepathic field to learnwhat you can,and when you've learnt enough, what do you do? You can't conquer theworld using snowmen. Snowmen are rubbish in July. You'll have to bebetter than that.You'll have to evolve.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sir, it appears to be stuck!<|endoftext|>
|0| What have you done? Have you locked the doors?<|endoftext|>
|1| You need to translate yourself into something more, well,human.<|endoftext|>
|0| Kick it down.<|endoftext|>
|1| To do that you'd need a perfect duplicate of human DNA in iceform. Where do you find that?<|endoftext|>
|0| Sir?<|endoftext|>
|0| Get in here, quickly!<|endoftext|>
|0| I've got a master key somewhere, sir.<|endoftext|>
|1| Now, let's see. Most opened file, most viewed page.<|endoftext|>
|1| You know, you really should delete your history. Governessfrozen in pond. Gotcha!<|endoftext|>
|0| Got it, sir!<|endoftext|>
|0| Get in here! Take him downstairs.<|endoftext|>
|1| Body frozen in a pond. The snow gets a goodlong look at a human being, like a full body scan. Everything they needto evolve.Pond. Good point, Clara. What are you doing here?<|endoftext|>
|0| Madame Vastra wondered if you were needing any grenades?<|endoftext|>
|1| Grenades?<|endoftext|>
|0| She might have said help.<|endoftext|>
|1| Help for what?<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, your investigation.<|endoftext|>
|1| Investigation? Who says I'm investigating? Do you think I'mgoing to start investigating just because some bird smiles at me? Whodo you think I am?<|endoftext|>
|0| Sherlock Holmes.<|endoftext|>
|1| Don't be clever, Strax. It doesn't suit you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry, sir.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm the clever one, you're the potato one.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, sir.<|endoftext|>
|1| Now go away.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, Mister Holmes.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oi! Shut up. You're not clever or funny and you've got tinylittle legs!<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay, just tell her you're leaving, you're not going up.Leaving. Not going up.<|endoftext|>
|1| What was that about? Five minutes, where did that come from?You.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's the human male from the Institute. What's he doing here?Suggest we melt his brain using projectile acid fish, and theninterrogate him. Other way round.<|endoftext|>
|0| Am I going to have the nightmaretonight?<|endoftext|>
|0| Definitely not.<|endoftext|>
|0| How do you know?<|endoftext|>
|0| Because someone's coming to help.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who?<|endoftext|>
|0| You wouldn't believe me if I told you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Is it one of your stories? Your definitely true ones?<|endoftext|>
|0| Ha! All my stories are true.<|endoftext|>
|0| Like how you were born behind the clock face of Big Ben?<|endoftext|>
|0| Accounting for my acute sense of time.<|endoftext|>
|0| And you invented fish.<|endoftext|>
|0| Because I dislike swimming alone.<|endoftext|>
|0| So what's this one?<|endoftext|>
|0| There's a man called the Doctor. He lives on a cloud in the sky,and all he does, all day every day, is to stop all the children in theworld ever having bad dreams.<|endoftext|>
|0| I've been having bad dreams.<|endoftext|>
|0| He's been on holiday. But I am confident he has now returned towork. And as a matter of fact, he's right here.<|endoftext|>
|0| Aren't you, Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|0| Bloomin' hell!<|endoftext|>
|0| The children have been very naughty.<|endoftext|>
|0| Get back. Now. Quickly.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're doing your other voice.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes love, did you notice?<|endoftext|>
|0| Naughty, naughty children.<|endoftext|>
|0| Run!<|endoftext|>
|0| What do we do?<|endoftext|>
|0| Frannie, Frannie, imagine her melting.<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|0| In your head. Melt her.<|endoftext|>
|0| I can't!<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm getting impatient!<|endoftext|>
|0| You have been very naughty!<|endoftext|>
|0| What about the man? You said the man was here, the cloud man.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, he's not, is he?<|endoftext|>
|0| Where's the Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't know!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor? Doctor? Doctor who?<|endoftext|>
|1| That's the way to do it.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oi. Ow.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where did she go? Will she come back?<|endoftext|>
|1| No, don't worry. She's currently draining through your carpet.New setting. Anti-freeze. And you're very welcome, by the way.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm very grateful. I knew you'd come.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, you didn't, because I don't. Because this isn't the sort ofthing I do any more. Next time you're in trouble, don't expect me to<|endoftext|>
|0| What is it? What's wrong?<|endoftext|>
|1| Sorry, it's just. Didn't know I'd put it on.<|endoftext|>
|1| Old habits<|endoftext|>
|0| It's cooler.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, it is, isn't it? It is very cool. Bow ties are cool.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, the room. The room's getting colder.<|endoftext|>
|0| She's coming back!<|endoftext|>
|0| What's she going to do? Is she going to punish me?<|endoftext|>
|1| Er, er, she's learnt not to melt. Of course, she's not really agoverness, she's just a beast. She's going to eat you. Run.<|endoftext|>
|0| Children, what is the expla. Who the devil are you? What areyou doing in my house?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's okay. I am your governess' gentleman friend, and we'vejust been upstairs kissing!<|endoftext|>
|0| Captain Latimer. In the garden, there's snowmen! And they'rejust growing out of nowhere, all by themselves. Look!<|endoftext|>
|0| Good evening. I'm a Lizard Woman from the Dawn of Time, andthis is my wife.<|endoftext|>
|0| This dwelling is under attack. Remain calm, human scum.<|endoftext|>
|1| So, any questions?<|endoftext|>
|0| You have a gentleman friend?<|endoftext|>
|1| Vastra, what's happening?<|endoftext|>
|0| The snow is highly localised, and on this occasion notnaturally occurring.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's coming out of that cab parked by the gates.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sir, one pulver grenade would blow these snowmen to smithereens.<|endoftext|>
|1| They're made of snow, Strax. They're already smithereens. See,Clara? Our friends again.<|endoftext|>
|0| Clara? Who's Clara?<|endoftext|>
|1| Your current governess is in reality a former barmaid calledClara.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's the way to do it!<|endoftext|>
|1| Meanwhile your previous governess is now a living ice sculptureimpersonating Mister Punch. Jenny, what have you got?<|endoftext|>
|0| That should hold it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sir, this room. One observational window on the line of attackand one defendable entrance.<|endoftext|>
|1| Right, everyone in there. Now. Move it. You, carry her.<|endoftext|>
|0| Nice to see you off your cloud and engaging again.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm not engaging again, I'm under attack.<|endoftext|>
|0| You missed this, didn't you?<|endoftext|>
|1| Shut up.<|endoftext|>
|1| Strax, how long have we got?<|endoftext|>
|0| They're not going to attack. They made no attempt to concealtheir arrival. An attack force would never abandon surprise so easily,and they're clearly in a defence formation.<|endoftext|>
|1| Way, aye, aye. Well done, Straxie. Still got it, buddy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sir, please do not noogie me during combat prep.<|endoftext|>
|1| So there's something here they want.<|endoftext|>
|0| The ice woman.<|endoftext|>
|1| Exactly.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why's she so important?<|endoftext|>
|1| Because she's a perfect duplication of human DNA in ice crystalform. The ultimate fusion of snow and humanity.To live here, the snow needs to evolve and she's the blueprint. She'swhat they need to become. When the snow melted last night, did thepond?<|endoftext|>
|0| No.<|endoftext|>
|1| Living ice that will never melt. If the snow gets hold of thatcreature on the stairs, it will learn to make more of them.It will build an army of ice. And it will be the last day of humanityon this planet.<|endoftext|>
|1| Stay here.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oi, I told you to stay in there.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, I didn't listen.<|endoftext|>
|1| You do that a lot.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's why you like me.<|endoftext|>
|1| Who said I like you?<|endoftext|>
|0| I think you just did.<|endoftext|>
|1| You kissed me.<|endoftext|>
|0| You blushed. And we just. Shut up.<|endoftext|>
|0| Release her to us. You have five minutes.<|endoftext|>
|1| We need to get her out of here but keep her away from them.<|endoftext|>
|0| How?<|endoftext|>
|1| With this. Do I always have to state the obvious?<|endoftext|>
|0| Those creatures outside, what are they?<|endoftext|>
|1| No danger to you, as long as I get that thing out of here. You,in there, now.<|endoftext|>
|0| What are you doing?<|endoftext|>
|1| Between you and me, I can't wait to find out.<|endoftext|>
|1| Right, if you look after everyone here, then I can. Clara!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| That was stupid.<|endoftext|>
|0| You were stupid, too.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm allowed. I'm good at stupid.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's the way to do it!<|endoftext|>
|0| Why does she keep saying that?<|endoftext|>
|1| Mirroring. Random mirroring. We need to get on the roof.<|endoftext|>
|0| This way!<|endoftext|>
|1| No, I do the hand grabbing. That's my job. That's always me!<|endoftext|>
|1| Come on, quickly! What are you doing?<|endoftext|>
|0| My bustle is stuck.<|endoftext|>
|1| Your bustle?<|endoftext|>
|1| You're going to have to take those clothes off. I didn't mean.<|endoftext|>
|0| I know. I understand, I do.<|endoftext|>
|1| Good.<|endoftext|>
|0| Now, what's the plan?<|endoftext|>
|1| Who said I've got a plan?<|endoftext|>
|0| Course you've got a plan. You took that.<|endoftext|>
|1| Maybe I'm an idiot.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're not. You're clever. Really clever.<|endoftext|>
|1| Are you?<|endoftext|>
|1| If I've got a plan, what is it? You tell me.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's the way to do it!<|endoftext|>
|0| Is this a test?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| What will it do to us?<|endoftext|>
|1| Kill us.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's the way to do it!<|endoftext|>
|1| So, come on then. Plan. Do I have one?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, I know what your plan is. I knew straight away.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, you didn't.<|endoftext|>
|0| Course I did.<|endoftext|>
|1| Show me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why should I?<|endoftext|>
|1| Because we'll be dead in under thirty seconds. Do I have aplan?<|endoftext|>
|0| If we'd been escaping, we'd be climbing down the building. Ifwe'd been hiding, we'd be on the other side of the roof. But no, we'restanding right here.<|endoftext|>
|1| So?<|endoftext|>
|0| So!<|endoftext|>
|0| After you.<|endoftext|>
|1| After you.<|endoftext|>
|0| After you, I'm wearing a dress. Eyes front, soldier!<|endoftext|>
|1| My eyes are always front!<|endoftext|>
|0| Mine aren't.<|endoftext|>
|1| Stop it.<|endoftext|>
|0| No. I understand you're the previous governess. I regret toinform you the position is taken. Goodnight.<|endoftext|>
|0| So you can move your cloud? You can controlit?<|endoftext|>
|1| No. No one can control clouds, that would be silly. The wind, alittle bit.<|endoftext|>
|0| She's following us.<|endoftext|>
|1| That's the idea. Keep her away from the snow. So. Barmaid orgoverness, which is it?<|endoftext|>
|0| That thing is after us, and you want a chat?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, we can't chat after we've been horribly killed, can we?<|endoftext|>
|0| How did we get up so high so quick?<|endoftext|>
|1| Clever staircase. It's taller on the inside.<|endoftext|>
|0| What am I standing on, what's this made of?<|endoftext|>
|1| Super dense water vapour. Should keep her trapped for themoment.<|endoftext|>
|0| Do you actually live up here on a cloud, ina box?<|endoftext|>
|1| I have done for a long time now.<|endoftext|>
|0| Blimey, you really know how to sulk, don't you?<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm not sulking.<|endoftext|>
|0| You live in a box!<|endoftext|>
|1| That's no more a box than you are a governess.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, spoken like a man. You know, you're the same as all therest. Sweet little Clara, works at the Rose And Crown, ideas above herstation.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, for your information, I'm not sweet onthe inside, and I'm certainly not<|endoftext|>
|0| Little.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's called the Tardis. It can travel anywhere in time andspace. And it's mine.<|endoftext|>
|0| But it's. Look at it, it's<|endoftext|>
|1| Go on, say it. Most people do.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's smaller on the outside.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay, that is a first.<|endoftext|>
|0| Is it magic? Is it a machine?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's a ship.<|endoftext|>
|0| A ship?<|endoftext|>
|1| Best ship in the universe.<|endoftext|>
|0| Is there a kitchen?<|endoftext|>
|1| Another first.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't know why I asked that. It's just, I like makingsoufflés.<|endoftext|>
|1| Soufflés?<|endoftext|>
|0| Why are you showing me all this?<|endoftext|>
|1| You followed me, remember? I didn't invite you.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're nearly a foot taller than I am. You could've reached theladder without this. You took it for me. Why?<|endoftext|>
|1| I never know why. I only know who.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's this?<|endoftext|>
|1| Me. Giving in.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't know why I'm crying.<|endoftext|>
|1| I do. Remember this. This right now, remember all of it.Because this is the day. This is the day. This is the day everythingbegins.<|endoftext|>
|1| Clara! Clara!<|endoftext|>
|0| Get off of me!<|endoftext|>
|1| Water vapour doesn't stop ice. I should've realised.<|endoftext|>
|0| Get off!<|endoftext|>
|1| Let her go. Let her go now! Now!<|endoftext|>
|0| Get off of me!<|endoftext|>
|1| No. Clara!<|endoftext|>
|1| Nooooo!<|endoftext|>
|0| What was that?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's Clara.<|endoftext|>
|0| Dear God. Oh, dear God. Where did she fall from? We have toget her inside.<|endoftext|>
|0| Those things will kill you.<|endoftext|>
|0| She's hurt.<|endoftext|>
|0| She's dead.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is that? What is happening?<|endoftext|>
|0| He's bringing her in.<|endoftext|>
|0| That green woman said she was dead. How can she be alive now?<|endoftext|>
|0| This technology has capacities and abilities beyond anythingyour puny human mind could possibly understand. Try not to worry.<|endoftext|>
|0| Isn't the creature still a danger? It could reform.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, not in here.<|endoftext|>
|0| Then you should be with Miss Clara.<|endoftext|>
|1| She's going to be fine. I know she is. She has to be.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, her injuries are severe. That equipment will bring backanyone for a while, but long term<|endoftext|>
|1| It was my fault. I am responsible for what happened to Clara.She was in my care.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is the point of blaming yourself?<|endoftext|>
|1| None. Because she's going to live.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hey. Hello.<|endoftext|>
|0| They all think I'm going to die, don't they?<|endoftext|>
|1| And I know you're going to live.<|endoftext|>
|0| How?<|endoftext|>
|1| I never know how. I just know who.<|endoftext|>
|0| The green lady. She said you were the saver of worlds once. Areyou going to save this one?<|endoftext|>
|1| If I do, will you come away with me?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well then. Merry Christmas.<|endoftext|>
|1| I have in my hand a piece of the Ice Lady.Everything you need to know about how to make ice people. Is that whatyou want? See you at the office.<|endoftext|>
|0| So then, Doctor, saving the world again?Might I ask why? Are you making a bargain with the universe? You'llsave the world to let her live?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes. And don't you think, after all this time and everythingI've ever done, that I am owed this one?<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't think the universe makes bargains.<|endoftext|>
|1| It was my fault.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well then. Better save the world.<|endoftext|>
|0| You promised us something. Have you brought it?<|endoftext|>
|1| Big fella here's been very quiet while you've been out. Whichis only to be expected, considering who he really is. Do you know whatthis is, big fella?<|endoftext|>
|0| I do not understand these markings.<|endoftext|>
|1| A map of the London Underground, 1967. Key strategic weaknessin metropolitan living, if you ask me, but then I have never liked atunnel.<|endoftext|>
|0| Enough of this. We are powerful, but on this planet we arelimited. We need to learn to take human form.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Governess is our most perfect replication of humanity.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's happening to its voice?<|endoftext|>
|1| Just stripping away the disguise.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, stop! Stop that. Cease, I command you.<|endoftext|>
|0| It sounds like a child.<|endoftext|>
|1| Of course it sounds like a child. It is a child. Simeon as achild. The snow has no voice without him.<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't listen to him, he's ruining everything.<|endoftext|>
|1| How long has the Intelligence been talking to you?<|endoftext|>
|0| I was a little boy. He was my snowman. He spoke to me.<|endoftext|>
|0| They're silly.<|endoftext|>
|1| But the snow doesn't talk, does it. It's just a mirror.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't want to talk to them. They're silly.<|endoftext|>
|0| They're silly.<|endoftext|>
|1| It just reflects back everything we think and feel and fear.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't need anyone else.<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't need anyone else.<|endoftext|>
|1| You poured your darkest dreams into a snowman and look, lookwhat it became.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't understand.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's a parasite feeding on the loneliness of a child and thesickness of an old man. Carnivorous snow meets Victorian values andsomething terrible is born.<|endoftext|>
|0| We can go on and do everything we planned.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh yes, and what a plan. A world full of living ice people. Ohdear me, how very Victorian of you.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's wrong with Victorian values?<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah, ah, ah. Are you sure?<|endoftext|>
|0| I have always been sure.<|endoftext|>
|1| Good. I'm glad you think so, since your entire adult life isabout to be erased. No parasite without a host. Without you, it willhave no voice. Without the governess, it will have no form.<|endoftext|>
|0| What, what, what's happening? What's happening? What did youdo?<|endoftext|>
|1| You've got nothing left to mirror any more. Goodbye.<|endoftext|>
|0| What did you, did you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Did you really think it would be so easy?<|endoftext|>
|1| That's not possible. How is that possible?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|0| They're growing! The snowmen are growing!<|endoftext|>
|0| What should we do?<|endoftext|>
|1| But you were just Doctor Simeon. You're notreal. He dreamed you. How can you still exist?<|endoftext|>
|0| Now the dream outlives the dreamer and can never die. Once Iwas the puppet.<|endoftext|>
|0| Now I pull the strings! I tried so long to take on human form.By erasing Simeon, you made space for me. I fill him now.<|endoftext|>
|0| More than snow, more than Simeon. Even this old body is strongin my control.<|endoftext|>
|1| Argh!<|endoftext|>
|0| Do you feel it? Winter is coming!<|endoftext|>
|1| Argh!<|endoftext|>
|0| Winter is coming!<|endoftext|>
|0| No, you must fight. Hang on and fight, boy.You can do it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Captain Latimer. Your children. They're afraid. Hold them.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's not really my area.<|endoftext|>
|0| It is now.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's happening?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, the globe. It's turning to rain. All of it, the snow,look.<|endoftext|>
|0| He's dead. What happened?<|endoftext|>
|1| The snow mirrors, that's all it does. It's mirroring somethingelse now. Something so strong, it's drowning everything else.<|endoftext|>
|1| There was a critical mass of snow at the house. If somethinghappened there<|endoftext|>
|0| It's salty. Salt water rain.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's not raining. It's crying. The only force on Earth thatcould drown the snow. A whole family crying on Christmas Eve.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm sorry. There was nothing to be done. She has moments only.<|endoftext|>
|1| We saved the world, Clara, you and me. We really, really did.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you going back to your cloud?<|endoftext|>
|1| No more cloud. Not now.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why not?<|endoftext|>
|1| It rained.<|endoftext|>
|0| Run. Run, you clever boy. And remember.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's Christmas. Christmas Day.<|endoftext|>
|0| And what about the Intelligence? Melted with the snow?<|endoftext|>
|1| No, I shouldn't think so. It learned to survive beyond physicalform.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, we can't be in much danger from a disembodied Intelligencethat thinks it can invade the world with snowmen.<|endoftext|>
|0| Or that the London Underground is a key strategic weakness.<|endoftext|>
|1| The Great Intelligence. Rings a bell. The Great Intelligence.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|1| I never knew her name. Her full name.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oswin Oswald. Junior Entertainment Manager, StarshipAlaska.<|endoftext|>
|1| Soufflé girl. Oswin. It was her.<|endoftext|>
|0| Run, you clever boy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Run, you clever boy.<|endoftext|>
|0| And remember.<|endoftext|>
|0| And remember.<|endoftext|>
|1| It was soufflé girl again. I never saw her face the first timewith the Daleks, but her voice, it was the same voice.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|1| The same woman, twice. And she died both times. The same woman!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, please, what are you talking about?<|endoftext|>
|1| Something's going on. Something impossible, something. Right,you two stay here. Stay right here. Don't move an inch.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you coming back?<|endoftext|>
|1| Shouldn't think so!<|endoftext|>
|0| But where are you going?<|endoftext|>
|1| To find her. To find Clara. Ha ha ha!<|endoftext|>
|0| But Clara's dead. What's he talking about, finding her?<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't know, but perhaps the universe makes bargains afterall.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where are you going?<|endoftext|>
|0| Short cut.<|endoftext|>
|0| Through there? I hate this place! Don't you think it's creepy?<|endoftext|>
|0| Nah. I don't believe in ghosts.<|endoftext|>
|1| Clara Oswin Oswald. Watch me run.<|endoftext|>
|0| Strax. Strax. Strax. Strax.<|endoftext|>
|0| Warning. Evacuating.<|endoftext|>
|0| Leave me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Warning. Evacuating.<|endoftext|>
|0| Go on. You must leave me here to die.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're not dying, Strax.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's fine. Don't worry. It's a glorious thing for a Sontaran todie in battle.<|endoftext|>
|0| The battle was two days ago. You've made a full recovery.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, I haven't.<|endoftext|>
|0| We've healed your wounds. You're completely fine.<|endoftext|>
|0| Nonsense! That was definitely a fatal shot. I didn't stand achance.<|endoftext|>
|0| I think you just fainted.<|endoftext|>
|0| Silence, boy.<|endoftext|>
|0| The station is being evacuated. We're all being returned to ourproper times and places. We wondered if you would like to come with us.<|endoftext|>
|0| We're from London, 1888.<|endoftext|>
|0| What of it? Is there something there for me?<|endoftext|>
|0| A welcome.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why?<|endoftext|>
|0| We fought together, didn't we, side by side as comrades?<|endoftext|>
|0| And we couldn't help noticing you do seem to be alone.<|endoftext|>
|0| I am accustomed to solitude.<|endoftext|>
|0| As are we. Jenny here has been ostracised by her family becauseof, well, let's just say preferences in companionship. I'm the last ofmy kind as you are the only one of yours. A Sontaran who fought bravelyin the best of causes.<|endoftext|>
|0| I thank you for your offer, but cannot accept, as you areputrescent alien filth.<|endoftext|>
|0| Indeed. We thought that would be a difficulty. Come along,Jenny. Time to go home.<|endoftext|>
|0| Although. This planet of which you speak, London, what do you dothere?<|endoftext|>
|0| Solve crimes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Protect the Empire.<|endoftext|>
|0| There's quite a lot of running.<|endoftext|>
|0| Some spectacular dresses.<|endoftext|>
|0| And an awful lot of fun.<|endoftext|>
|0| I suppose I could make a preliminary reconnaissance of thisLondon place. It may need to be assessed for military protection.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's the spirit.<|endoftext|>
|0| Thank you for the opportunity. I look forward to obliteratingyou both in the name of the Sontaran Empire. I'm not an expert on alienspecies, but you're both women ones, aren't you?<|endoftext|>
|0| It has been noted.<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't you need a man one?<|endoftext|>
|0| No.<|endoftext|>
|0| Am I the man one?<|endoftext|>
|0| No.<|endoftext|>
|0| So, dresses, then.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hello.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why are you sitting on a swing?<|endoftext|>
|1| Why shouldn't I?<|endoftext|>
|0| Because you're old.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, that's true. That is very true.<|endoftext|>
|0| My mum says I shouldn't talk to strange men.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah, you mum's right.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you strange?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, dear. I'm way past strange. I think I'm probablyincredible.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you lonely?<|endoftext|>
|1| Why would I be lonely?<|endoftext|>
|0| Because you're sad. Have you lost something?<|endoftext|>
|1| No.<|endoftext|>
|0| When I lose something, I go to a quiet place and I close my eyes,and then I can remember where I put it.<|endoftext|>
|1| Good plan.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm always losing things. I lost my best pencil, my schoolbag,and my gran, and my mojo.<|endoftext|>
|1| Your mojo?<|endoftext|>
|0| I got it back, though.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hey, that's good.<|endoftext|>
|0| What did you lose?<|endoftext|>
|1| My friend. I met her twice before and I lost her both times,and now I don't think I'll ever find her again.<|endoftext|>
|0| Have you been looking?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, everywhere.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's sad.<|endoftext|>
|1| It is a bit. Hey, is that your mum?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, I'd better go and see if she's all right.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, I think you better had.<|endoftext|>
|0| How are you going to find her?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, the first two times I met her, I just sort of bumped intoher, so I thought maybe if I just wandered about a bit, I might bumpinto her again. You know, like destiny, sort of.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's rubbish.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, I think it probably is. Hey, maybe I could find a quietroom and have a good think about it instead.<|endoftext|>
|0| That would be better. Goodbye.<|endoftext|>
|1| Goodbye.<|endoftext|>
|0| Mister, I hope you find her again.<|endoftext|>
|1| So do I.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who was that?<|endoftext|>
|0| I was talking to a sad man.<|endoftext|>
|0| Look, Clara Oswald, what have I told you about talking to strangemen?<|endoftext|>
|0| Danger. This is a warning. A warning to the whole world. You'relooking for wifi. Sometimes you see something.<|endoftext|>
|0| A bit like this. Don't click it. Do not click it. Once you'veclicked it, they're in your computer.<|endoftext|>
|0| They can see you. And they can see you, they might choose you.And if they do, you die. For twenty four hours, you're dead. For awhile. People's souls are being uploaded to the internet. And somepeople get stuck. Their minds, their souls, in the wifi. Like echoes,like ghosts. Sometimes you can hear their screams on the radio, on thetelly, on the net. This is real. This is not a hoax.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't know where I am.<|endoftext|>
|0| Or a joke.<|endoftext|>
|0| Or a story.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't know where I am.<|endoftext|>
|0| This is real, and I know that, because I don't know where I am.Please, please, if you can hear me, if you can hear me, I don't knowwhere I am.<|endoftext|>
|0| Wake the Abbott. The bells of Saint John are ringing.<|endoftext|>
|0| We must go to him.<|endoftext|>
|0| They call him the mad monk, don't they.<|endoftext|>
|0| They shouldn't. He's definitely not a monk.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ahem. I'm sorry to intrude, but the bellsof Saint John are ringing.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm going to need a horse.<|endoftext|>
|0| Is that her?<|endoftext|>
|0| The woman twice dead, and her final message. He was drawn tothis place of peace and solitude that he might divine her meaning. Ifhe truly is mad, then this is his madness.<|endoftext|>
|0| Angie? Is the internet working? Trying to phone the helpline,they won't answer.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's working for me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Can I use it when you're finished?<|endoftext|>
|0| More than one person can use the internet at a time, Clara.<|endoftext|>
|0| You done your homework?<|endoftext|>
|0| Shut up, you're not my mum.<|endoftext|>
|0| And I'm not trying to be, okay?<|endoftext|>
|0| Right. Yes. Angie's probably fine on her own. You can probablyhave the night off.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm okay. I'll be upstairs when I figure out my computer.<|endoftext|>
|0| Anyway, the adverts are in, so hopefully we'll find someone.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm here as long as you need me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Good. Right, come along, Artie. Time to go.<|endoftext|>
|0| What chapter are you on?<|endoftext|>
|0| Ten.<|endoftext|>
|0| Eleven is the best. You'll cry your eyes out.<|endoftext|>
|0| Artie!<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, come on! Just answer. Pick it up. Pick it up. Pick it up.<|endoftext|>
|1| That is not supposed to happen.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hello?<|endoftext|>
|0| Ah, hello. I can't find the internet.<|endoftext|>
|1| Sorry?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's gone, the internet.<|endoftext|>
|0| Can't find it anywhere. Where is it?<|endoftext|>
|1| The internet?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, the internet.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why don't I have the internet?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's twelve oh seven.<|endoftext|>
|0| I've got half past three. Am I phoning adifferent time zone?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, you really sort of are.<|endoftext|>
|0| Will it show up on the bill?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, I dread to think. Listen, where did you get this number?<|endoftext|>
|0| The woman in the shop wrote it down.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's a help line, isn't it? She said it'sthe best help line out there.<|endoftext|>
|0| In the universe, she said.<|endoftext|>
|1| What woman? Who was she?<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't know. The woman in the shop. So<|endoftext|>
|0| Why isn't there internet? Shouldn't it sortof<|endoftext|>
|0| Be there?<|endoftext|>
|1| Look, listen, I'm not actually, it isn't. You have clicked onthe wifi button, yeah?<|endoftext|>
|0| Hang on. Wifi.<|endoftext|>
|0| Click on the wifi, you'll see a list of names. You see oneyou recognise.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's asking me for a password.<|endoftext|>
|0| Is it okay if I go and see Nina? You can call her mum.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sure. What's the password for the internet?<|endoftext|>
|0| R Y C B A R 1 2 3.<|endoftext|>
|0| How am I supposed to remember that?<|endoftext|>
|0| Is it an evil spirit?<|endoftext|>
|1| A woman.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hang on.<|endoftext|>
|0| A mo. Run you clever boy and remember onetwo three<|endoftext|>
|1| What did you say?<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't shout. Now you've made me type itwrong. It's thrown me out again. What do I do? How do I get back in?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's just a thing to rememberthe password, run you clever boy and remember. Hang on.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello? Yes, I hear you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yep. Ah ha.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello.<|endoftext|>
|1| Clara. Clara Oswald.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello.<|endoftext|>
|1| Clara Oswin Oswald.<|endoftext|>
|0| Just Clara Oswald. What was that middle one?<|endoftext|>
|1| Do you remember me?<|endoftext|>
|0| No. Should I? Who are you?<|endoftext|>
|1| The Doctor. No? The Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor who?<|endoftext|>
|1| No, just the Doctor. Actually, sorry, could you start all thatagain?<|endoftext|>
|0| Could I what?<|endoftext|>
|1| Could you just ask me that question again?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor who?<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay, just once more.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor who?<|endoftext|>
|1| Ooo, yeah. Ooo. Do you know, I never realised how much I enjoyhearing that said out loud. Thank you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hey, no, Clara, please. Clara, I need to talk to you. Listen.Please.<|endoftext|>
|0| Clara Oswald. We've got a positive lock onher, but I think she's borderline. Very clever but no computer skills.<|endoftext|>
|0| Upload her anyway. Splice her a computer skills package.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'll activate a spoonhead.<|endoftext|>
|0| Alexi, we call them servers, not spoonheads.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry. Excuse me.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm ever so fond of Alexi, but my conscience says we shouldprobably kill him.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'll inform HR.<|endoftext|>
|0| Actually, he's about to go on holiday. Kill him when he getsback. Let's not be unreasonable.<|endoftext|>
|0| Didn't you want to speak to me?<|endoftext|>
|0| We're uploading too many people too quickly. We're going to getnoticed.<|endoftext|>
|0| If your conscience is bothering you, think of it like this.We're preserving living minds inpermanent form in the data cloud. It's like immortality, only fatal.<|endoftext|>
|0| My conscience is fine.<|endoftext|>
|0| Good. Because our client has his needs.<|endoftext|>
|0| Did you just hack me?<|endoftext|>
|0| Because you changed your mind?<|endoftext|>
|0| I hope I did.<|endoftext|>
|1| Please, I just need to speak to you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why are you still here? Why are you here at all?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oi, you phoned me. You were looking for theinternet.<|endoftext|>
|0| That was you?<|endoftext|>
|1| Of course it was me.<|endoftext|>
|0| How did you get here so fast?<|endoftext|>
|0| I just happened to be in theneighbourhood, on my mobile phone.<|endoftext|>
|0| When you say mobile phone, why do you point at that blue box?<|endoftext|>
|0| Because it's a surprisingly accurate description.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, we're finished now.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oi, no, don't.<|endoftext|>
|0| Angie? Angie, you upstairs? Angie, you still here?<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you a friend of Angie's?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm a friend of Angie's.<|endoftext|>
|0| What were you doing upstairs?<|endoftext|>
|0| I was upstairs.<|endoftext|>
|0| I know you, don't I?<|endoftext|>
|0| You know me, don't you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Right. Don't be a monk. Monks are not cool.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah ha! Clara! Clara?<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello?<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah, see? Look, it's me. De-monked. Sensible clothes. Can I comein now?<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't understand.<|endoftext|>
|1| You just open the door.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't know.<|endoftext|>
|1| Of course you can.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where I am. I don't know where I am.Where am I? Please tell me where I am. I don't know where I am.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't know where I am. I don't knowwhere I am!<|endoftext|>
|1| Clara? Clara?<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't know where I am. I don't know where I am. I don'tunderstand. I don't know where I am! I don't understand. I don't knowwhere I am.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where am I? I don't know where I am.<|endoftext|>
|0| I've got a problem.<|endoftext|>
|1| Walking base station. Walking wifi base station. Hoovering updata. Hoovering up people.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh no, you don't.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh no, you don't.<|endoftext|>
|0| Looks like someone is trying to reverse anupload.<|endoftext|>
|0| Is that possible?<|endoftext|>
|0| The upload isn't fully integrated yet. In theory, yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, my god.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Not this time,Clara, I promise.<|endoftext|>
|0| Can you stop this?<|endoftext|>
|0| No.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay. It's okay, it's okay. You're fine. You're back. Yes, youare. Oh yes, you are.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well?<|endoftext|>
|0| Our hacker sent a message.<|endoftext|>
|0| I assume he's talking about the girl.<|endoftext|>
|0| Get out. I have to speak to the client.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sir. The one you told me about, he's here. The Doctor is here.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello?<|endoftext|>
|1| Hello! Are you all right?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm in bed.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't remember going.<|endoftext|>
|1| No.<|endoftext|>
|0| What did I miss?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, quite a lot, actually. Angie called. She's going to stayover at Nina's. Apparently that's all completely fine and you shouldn'tworry like you always do. For god's sake get off her back. Also, yourdad phoned, mainly about the government. He seems very cross with them,I've got several pages on that. I said I'd look into it. I fixed thatrattling noise in the washing machine, indexed the kitchen cupboards,optimised photosynthesis in the main flower bed and assembled aquadricycle.<|endoftext|>
|0| Assembled a what?<|endoftext|>
|1| I found a disassembled quadricycle in the garage.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't think you did.<|endoftext|>
|1| I invented the quadricycle. Ha!<|endoftext|>
|0| What happened to me?<|endoftext|>
|1| Don't you remember?<|endoftext|>
|0| I was scared, really scared. Didn't know where I was.<|endoftext|>
|1| Do you know now?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well then, you should go to sleep. Because you're safe now, Ipromise. Goodnight, Clara.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you guarding me?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, yes. Yes, I am.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you seriously going to sit down there all night?<|endoftext|>
|1| I promise I won't budge from this spot.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well then, I'll have to come to you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Eh?<|endoftext|>
|0| I take it the girl's inside, and alive?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Alexi, I need you to do something creative about that.<|endoftext|>
|1| I like your house.<|endoftext|>
|0| It isn't mine. I'm a friend of the family.<|endoftext|>
|1| But you look after the kids. Oh yes, you're a governess, aren'tyou, just like<|endoftext|>
|0| Just like what?<|endoftext|>
|1| Just like. I thought you probably would be.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you going to explain what happened to me?<|endoftext|>
|1| There's something in the wifi.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay.<|endoftext|>
|1| This whole world is swimming in wifi. We're living in a wifisoup. Suppose something got inside it. Suppose there was somethingliving in the wifi, harvesting human minds. Extracting them. Imaginethat. Human souls trapped like flies in the world-wide web. Stuckforever, crying out for help.<|endoftext|>
|0| Isn't that basically Twitter?<|endoftext|>
|0| What's that face for?<|endoftext|>
|1| A computer can hack another computer. A living, sentientcomputer, maybe that could hack people. Edit them. Re-write them.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why would you say that?<|endoftext|>
|1| Because a few hours ago you knew nothing about the internet,and you just made a joke about Twitter.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh. Oh, that's weird. I know all about computers now in my head.Where did all that come from?<|endoftext|>
|1| You were uploaded for a while. Wherever you were, you broughtsomething extra back, which I very much doubt you'll be allowed tokeep.<|endoftext|>
|1| You and me inside that box, now.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm sorry?<|endoftext|>
|1| Look, just get inside.<|endoftext|>
|0| Both of us?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, trust me. You'll understand once we're in there.<|endoftext|>
|0| I bet I will. What is that box, anyway? Why have you got a box?Is it like a snogging booth?<|endoftext|>
|1| Clara. A what?<|endoftext|>
|0| Is that what you do, bring a booth? There is such a thing as tookeen.<|endoftext|>
|1| Clara, look around you.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's going on? What's happening? Is the wifi switching on thelights?<|endoftext|>
|1| No, people are switching on the lights. The wifi is switchingon the people.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is that thing?<|endoftext|>
|1| A walking base station. You saw one earlier.<|endoftext|>
|0| I saw a little girl.<|endoftext|>
|1| It must have taken an image from your subconscious, thrown itback at you. Ah! Activecamouflage. They could be everywhere.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor? Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's going on?<|endoftext|>
|0| Do we need another London-wide activation?We can't always pass it off as a riot.<|endoftext|>
|0| Our lights are on and everyone else's off.Why?<|endoftext|>
|1| Some planes have wifi.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm sorry?<|endoftext|>
|1| We must be one hell of a target right now.<|endoftext|>
|1| You, me, box, right now.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, it's a spaceship. Yes, it's bigger onthe inside. Now, I don't have time to talk about it.<|endoftext|>
|0| But, but, but, but it's<|endoftext|>
|1| Shut up, please. Short hops are difficult.<|endoftext|>
|0| Bigger on the inside. Actually bigger.<|endoftext|>
|1| Right, come on.<|endoftext|>
|0| We're going to go back out there?<|endoftext|>
|1| We've moved. It's a spaceship. We flew away.<|endoftext|>
|0| Away from the plane?<|endoftext|>
|1| Not exactly.<|endoftext|>
|0| How did we get here?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's a ship. I told you. It's all very sciency.<|endoftext|>
|0| This is the plane? The actual plane? Are they all dead?<|endoftext|>
|1| Asleep. Switched off by the wifi. Never mind them.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is going on? Is this real? Please, tell me what ishappening!<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm the Doctor. I'm an alien from outer space. I'm a thousandyears old, I've got two hearts and I can't fly a plane! Can you?<|endoftext|>
|0| No.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, fine. Let's do it together.<|endoftext|>
|1| Whoo! Would a victory roll be too showy offy?<|endoftext|>
|0| What the hell's going on?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, I'm blocking your wifi so you're waking up, for a start.Tell you what, do you want to drive?<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't understand. That box, where's it gone? Find that box!<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay. When are you going to explain to mewhat the hell is going on?<|endoftext|>
|1| Breakfast.<|endoftext|>
|0| What? I ain't waiting till breakfast.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's a time machine. You never have to wait for breakfast.<|endoftext|>
|1| Thank you, thank you. Yes, magic blue box.<|endoftext|>
|1| All donations gratefully accepted. Roll up, give us your dosh.Pennies, pounds, anything you've got.<|endoftext|>
|1| Keep collecting. We need enough for breakfast. Just poppingback to the garage.<|endoftext|>
|0| Garage?<|endoftext|>
|1| This way.<|endoftext|>
|0| So this is tomorrow, then. Tomorrow's comeearly.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, it came at the usual time. We just took a short cut. Thankyou, thank you. Tomorrow, a camel.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's happening?<|endoftext|>
|0| Blue box, South bank. Definitely wasn't there five minutes ago.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are we sure this time? Earl's Court was an embarrassment.<|endoftext|>
|0| If you've got a flying time machine, why are we on a motorbike?<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't take the Tardis into battle.<|endoftext|>
|0| Because it's made of wood?<|endoftext|>
|1| Because it's the most powerful ship in the universe and I don'twant it falling into the wrong hands. Okay?<|endoftext|>
|0| I do love London. So many cameras.<|endoftext|>
|0| So if we can travel anywhere in time and space, why did wetravel to the morning. What's the point in that?<|endoftext|>
|1| Whoever's after us spent the whole night looking for us. Areyou tired?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|1| What? Then imagine how they feel. They came the long way round.They've got to be close. Definitely London going by the signaldistribution. I can hack the lowest level of their operating system butI can't establish a physical location. The security's too good.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you an alien?<|endoftext|>
|1| I am. Yes, okay with that?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, yeah. Think I'm fine.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, good.<|endoftext|>
|0| So, what happens if you do find them? What happens then?<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't know. I can't tell the future, I just work there.<|endoftext|>
|0| You don't have a plan?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, you know what I always say about plans.<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't have one.<|endoftext|>
|0| People always have plans.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes. Yes, I suppose they do. So tell me, how long have you beenlooking after those kids?<|endoftext|>
|0| About a year, since their mum died.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay. Why you? Family friend, I get that, but there must havebeen others. Why did it have to be you? You don't really seem like ananny.<|endoftext|>
|0| Gimme.<|endoftext|>
|1| Sorry. What?<|endoftext|>
|0| You need to know where they physically are. Their exactlocation.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| I can do it.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oi, hang on. I need that.<|endoftext|>
|0| You've hacked the lower operating system, yeah? I'll have theirphysical location in under five minutes. Pop off and get us a coffee.<|endoftext|>
|1| If I can't find them, you definitely can't.<|endoftext|>
|0| They uploaded me, remember? I've got computing stuff in my head.<|endoftext|>
|1| So do I.<|endoftext|>
|0| I have insane hacking skills.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm from space and the future with two hearts and twenty sevenbrains.<|endoftext|>
|0| And I can find them in under five minutes plus photographs.Twenty seven?<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay, slight exaggeration.<|endoftext|>
|0| Coffee, go get. Five minutes, I promise.<|endoftext|>
|1| The security is absolute.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's never about the security, it's about the people.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why do you keep looking at me like that?<|endoftext|>
|1| Sorry, no, it's nothing. It's just, you're a nanny. Isn't thata bit, well, Victorian?<|endoftext|>
|0| Victorian?<|endoftext|>
|1| You're young. Shouldn't you be doing, you know, young things,with young people?<|endoftext|>
|0| You mean like you, for instance? Down, boy.<|endoftext|>
|1| No. No. I didn't. Shut up.<|endoftext|>
|1| Two more cappuccinos over there, please.<|endoftext|>
|0| One moment, sir.<|endoftext|>
|0| You realise you haven't the slightest chance of saving yourlittle friend.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm sorry, what?<|endoftext|>
|0| One moment, sir. I said, there's not the slightest chance ofsaving your little friend. And don't annoy the old man. He isn't, infact, speaking.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm speaking. Just using whatever's to hand.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, she's rather pretty, isn't she? Do youlike her?<|endoftext|>
|0| Make her like you, too, if you want.(flicker) You all right, sir?<|endoftext|>
|1| Er, yes. Yes. Fine.<|endoftext|>
|1| You okay?<|endoftext|>
|0| Sure. Setting up stuff. Need a user name.<|endoftext|>
|1| Learning fast.<|endoftext|>
|0| Clara Oswald for the win. Oswin!<|endoftext|>
|0| You can always call me Oswin, seeing as that'smy name.<|endoftext|>
|0| Now I want you to take a look around. Goon, have a little stroll.<|endoftext|>
|0| And see how impossible your situation is.<|endoftext|>
|0| Go on, take a look. I do love showingoff.<|endoftext|>
|0| Just let me show you what control of the wifi can do for you.Stop!<|endoftext|>
|1| I saw what you can do last night.<|endoftext|>
|0| And clear.<|endoftext|>
|0| We can hack anyone in the wifi once they've been exposedlong enough.<|endoftext|>
|1| So there's one of your walking base stations here, somewhereclose.<|endoftext|>
|0| There's always someone close. We'vereleased thousands into the world.<|endoftext|>
|0| They home in on the wifi like ratssniffing cheese.<|endoftext|>
|0| There's something up with the webcams.<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't know who you are or why you'redoing this, but the people of this world will not be harmed. They willnot controlled.They will not be<|endoftext|>
|0| The people of this world are<|endoftext|>
|0| In no danger whatsoever. My client requiresa steady diet of living human minds. Healthy, free-range, human minds.He loves and cares for humanity. In fact, he can't get enough of it.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's obscene. It's murder.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's life.<|endoftext|>
|0| The farmer tends his flock like a lovingparent.<|endoftext|>
|0| The abattoir is not a contradiction.<|endoftext|>
|0| No one loves cattle more than Burger King.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm sure of it. Someone's hacking thewebcams. All of them.<|endoftext|>
|0| Everybody check your webcams.<|endoftext|>
|0| But what would be the point, taking mug shots of us?<|endoftext|>
|0| Who's on Facebook?<|endoftext|>
|0| Bebo? MySpace? Abo?<|endoftext|>
|0| Put your hands down if you didn't mention where you work.<|endoftext|>
|1| This ends. I'm going to end this today.<|endoftext|>
|0| How? You don't even know<|endoftext|>
|0| Where we are.<|endoftext|>
|1| Who's doing this? Who is your client? Hmm?Answer me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Miss Kizlet, we have a problem.<|endoftext|>
|0| I did it. I really did. I did it. I did it. I found them.<|endoftext|>
|1| You found them.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Shard. They're in the Shard. Floor sixty five.<|endoftext|>
|1| Floor sixty five.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you listening to me, Doctor? I found them.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm listening to you. You found them.<|endoftext|>
|0| We've got her. This time we've really gother.<|endoftext|>
|1| Clara? Clara?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor? Doctor, help me. I, I don't know where I am. Idon't understand. Doctor, help me, please. I don't know where I am. Idon't know where I am! I don't know where I am. Doctor, please. Pleasehelp me. Please help me. I don't know where I am. I don't know where Iam.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, help me. I don't knowwhere I am.<|endoftext|>
|0| Should we pulp her or keep her as a hostage?<|endoftext|>
|0| There's no point. She's fully integrated now. She can't bedownloaded again. I'm sure he knows that.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm not sure he does. He's coming.<|endoftext|>
|0| We could stop him, I suppose.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why bother? Could be quite funny.<|endoftext|>
|0| Really, Doctor. A motorbike? Hardlyseems like you.<|endoftext|>
|1| I rode this in the antigrav Olympics, 2074. I came last.<|endoftext|>
|0| The building is in lock-down. I'm afraid you're notcoming in.<|endoftext|>
|1| Did you even hear the word, antigrav?<|endoftext|>
|0| Seriously? He can do that? He can reallyactually do that?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh dear lord.<|endoftext|>
|0| I think that was your office.<|endoftext|>
|0| Excuse me. I believe there's someone to see me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Do come in.<|endoftext|>
|1| Download her.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry about the draught.<|endoftext|>
|1| Download her back into her body right now.<|endoftext|>
|0| I can't.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, you can.<|endoftext|>
|0| She's a fully integrated part of the data cloud, now. She can'tbe separated.<|endoftext|>
|1| Then download the entire cloud. Everyone you've trapped inthere.<|endoftext|>
|0| You realise what would happen?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, those with bodies to go home to would be free.<|endoftext|>
|0| A tiny number. Most would simply die.<|endoftext|>
|1| They'd be released from a living hell. It's the best you can dofor them, so give the order.<|endoftext|>
|0| And why would I do that?<|endoftext|>
|1| Because I'm going to motivate you, any second now.<|endoftext|>
|0| You ridiculous man. Why did you even come here? Whatever for?<|endoftext|>
|1| I didn't.<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm still in the cafe.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm finishing my coffee. Lovely spot.<|endoftext|>
|0| You hack people, but me?<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm old-fashioned.<|endoftext|>
|0| I hack technology.<|endoftext|>
|1| Here's your motivation.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, not me! Not me!<|endoftext|>
|0| Put me back. Put me back!Download me at once! That is an order. That is an order!<|endoftext|>
|0| But she's fully integrated now. We'll have to download theentire cloud. We can't do that.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, we can't.<|endoftext|>
|0| Download me!<|endoftext|>
|0| Download me!<|endoftext|>
|0| Do what she says.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor? Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|0| You have no right to be in this office, andI am demanding that you leave at once.<|endoftext|>
|0| This building is under UNIT control.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is UNIT? Never heard of you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Just you calm down, sir.<|endoftext|>
|0| UNIT are here. Friends of the Doctor, I presume.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, old friends. Very old friends.<|endoftext|>
|0| Then I appear to have failed you, Great Intelligence.<|endoftext|>
|0| I have feasted on many minds. I havegrown. But now it is time for you to reduce.<|endoftext|>
|0| You've been whispering in my ear so long, I'm not sure Iremember what I was before.<|endoftext|>
|0| Goodbye, Miss Kizlet.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry. Where am I? What am I doing here? Areyou soldiers? What's happening? How did I get here?<|endoftext|>
|0| Excuse me, where are the toilets?<|endoftext|>
|0| The toilets?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm here to fix the toilets, the gents. How long have I beenhere?<|endoftext|>
|0| Stay where you are!<|endoftext|>
|0| Ma'am, identify yourself.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where are my mummy and daddy? They said they wouldn't be long.Are they coming back?<|endoftext|>
|1| Come in.<|endoftext|>
|0| So, he comes back, does he?<|endoftext|>
|1| You didn't answer my question.<|endoftext|>
|0| What question?<|endoftext|>
|1| You don't seem like a nanny.<|endoftext|>
|0| I was going to travel. I came to stay for a week before I left,and during that week<|endoftext|>
|1| She died, so you're returning the favour. You've got a hundredand one places to see, and you haven't been to any of them, have you?That's why you keep the book.<|endoftext|>
|0| I keep the book because I'm still going.<|endoftext|>
|1| But you don't run out on the people you care about. Wish I wasmore like that. You know, the thing about a time machine, you can runaway all you like and still be home in time for tea, so what do yousay? Anywhere. All of time and space, right outside those doors.<|endoftext|>
|0| Does this work?<|endoftext|>
|1| Eh?<|endoftext|>
|0| Is this actually what you do? Do you just crook your finger andpeople just jump in your snog box and fly away?<|endoftext|>
|1| It is not a snog box.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'll be the judge of that.<|endoftext|>
|1| Starting when?<|endoftext|>
|0| Come back tomorrow. Ask me again.<|endoftext|>
|1| Why?<|endoftext|>
|0| Because tomorrow, I might say yes. Sometime after seven okay foryou?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's a time machine. Any time's okay.<|endoftext|>
|0| See you then.<|endoftext|>
|1| Clara? In your book there was a leaf. Why?<|endoftext|>
|0| That wasn't a leaf. That was page one.<|endoftext|>
|1| Right then, Clara Oswald. Time to find out who you are.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, my stars. Are you all right?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah.<|endoftext|>
|0| So, I've got something for you.<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|0| You kept it?<|endoftext|>
|0| Of course I kept it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why?<|endoftext|>
|0| Because this exact leaf had to grow in that exact way in thatexact place so that precise wind could tear it from that precise branchand make it fly into this exact face at that exact moment. And if justone of those tiny little things had never happened, I'd never have metyou. Which makes this the most important leaf in human history.<|endoftext|>
|0| Give it a kick.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, my stars! Are you all right?<|endoftext|>
|1| Fine. Marvellous. Refulgent. Possibly a bit embarrassed. That'snot dangerous, is it?<|endoftext|>
|0| What's not?<|endoftext|>
|1| Embarrassment.<|endoftext|>
|0| Not usually. Not to my knowledge.<|endoftext|>
|1| Good. Hey. Phew.<|endoftext|>
|0| Mate, I'm so sorry. She wants to be Bryan Robson.<|endoftext|>
|1| No worries. My fault. No harm done. Hello there.<|endoftext|>
|0| Clara.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah. Hello there, Clara.<|endoftext|>
|1| She's just a girl. How can she be?<|endoftext|>
|1| She can't be. She is. She can't be. She's not possible.<|endoftext|>
|0| So we're moving through actual time? So what's it made of, time?I mean, if you can just rotor through it, it's got to be made of stuff,like jam's made of strawberries. So what's it made of?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, not strawberries. No. No, no, no. That would beunacceptable.<|endoftext|>
|0| And we can go anywhere?<|endoftext|>
|1| Within reason. Well, I say reason.<|endoftext|>
|0| So, we could go backwards in time.<|endoftext|>
|1| And space, yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| And forwards in time.<|endoftext|>
|1| And space. Totally. So, where do you want to go, eh? What doyou want to see?<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't know. You know when someone asks you what's yourfavourite book and straight away you forget every single book thatyou've ever read?<|endoftext|>
|1| No. Totally not.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, that's a thing that happens.<|endoftext|>
|1| And? Back to the question?<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay. So. So. So. So I'd like to see. I would like to see. WhatI would like to see is, something awesome.<|endoftext|>
|1| Can you feel the light on your eyelids? That is the light of analien sun. Forward a couple of steps. Okay. Are you ready?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes. No. Yes.<|endoftext|>
|1| Welcome to the Rings of Akhaten.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's.<|endoftext|>
|1| It is. It so completely is. But wait, there is more.<|endoftext|>
|0| More what?<|endoftext|>
|1| Wait, wait, wait.<|endoftext|>
|1| In about five, four, three, two<|endoftext|>
|0| What is it?<|endoftext|>
|1| The Pyramid of the Rings of Akhaten. It's a holy site for theSun Singers of Akhat.<|endoftext|>
|0| The who of what?<|endoftext|>
|1| Seven worlds orbiting the same star. All of them sharing abelief that life in the universe originated here, on that planet.<|endoftext|>
|0| All life?<|endoftext|>
|1| In the universe.<|endoftext|>
|0| Did it?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, it's what they believe. It's a nice story.<|endoftext|>
|0| Can we see it? Up close?<|endoftext|>
|0| Where are they from?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, you know, the local system, mostly.<|endoftext|>
|0| What do I call them?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, let's see. Ah! There go some Panbabylonians. ALugal-Irra-Kush. Some Lucanians. A Hooloovoo. Ah! Qom VoTivig.<|endoftext|>
|1| That chap's a Terraberserker of the Kodion Belt. You don't seemany of them around any more. Oh! That's an Ultramancer. Do you know, Iforget how much I like it here. We should come here more often.<|endoftext|>
|0| You've been here before?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, yes, yes. I came here a long time ago with mygranddaughter.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hang on!<|endoftext|>
|1| Exotic fruit of some description. (scans) Right. Non-toxic,non-hallucinogenic. High in free radicals and low in other stuff, Ishouldn't wonder.<|endoftext|>
|1| No?<|endoftext|>
|0| So, why is everyone here?<|endoftext|>
|1| For the Festival of Offerings. Takes place every thousand yearsor so, when the rings align. It's quite a big thing, locally, likePancake Tuesday.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh! Er, Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|0| What's happening? Why is it angry?<|endoftext|>
|1| This isn't an it, it's a she. Dor'een, meet Clara. Clara, meetDor'een.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doreen?<|endoftext|>
|1| Loose translation. She sounds a bit grumpy but she's a totallove actually, aren't you? Yes, you are. No, actually, she's justasking if we fancy renting a moped.<|endoftext|>
|0| So, how much does it cost?<|endoftext|>
|1| Not money. Something valuable. Sentimental value. A photograph,love letter, something like that. That's what's used for currency here.Psychometry. Objects psychically imprinted with their history. The moretreasured they are, the more value they hold.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's horrible.<|endoftext|>
|1| Better than using bits of paper.<|endoftext|>
|0| Then you pay.<|endoftext|>
|1| With what?<|endoftext|>
|0| You're a thousand years old. You must have something you careabout.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor? Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you okay?<|endoftext|>
|0| Have you seen her?<|endoftext|>
|0| Who?<|endoftext|>
|0| The Queen of Years.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who?<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello?<|endoftext|>
|0| Hey. Are you okay? Are you lost?<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you all right? What are you doing?<|endoftext|>
|0| Hiding.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh. Why?<|endoftext|>
|0| You don't know me?<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry. Actually not.<|endoftext|>
|0| So why did you follow me?<|endoftext|>
|0| To help. You looked lost.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't believe you.<|endoftext|>
|0| I've got no idea who you might be. I've never been here before.I've never been anywhere like here before. I just saw a little girl wholooked like she needed help.<|endoftext|>
|0| Really?<|endoftext|>
|0| Really really.<|endoftext|>
|0| Can you help me?<|endoftext|>
|0| That's why I'm still here.<|endoftext|>
|0| Because I need to hide.<|endoftext|>
|0| Merry. Where are you, Merry?<|endoftext|>
|0| I know the perfect box.<|endoftext|>
|0| Merry, where are you? Merry. Merry.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's this?<|endoftext|>
|0| A space-shippy thing. Timey, spacey.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's teeny.<|endoftext|>
|0| You wait.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, come on.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's wrong?<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't know. I don't think it likes me. Come on, let me in.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hey. Hey, little girl.<|endoftext|>
|0| My name's Merry.<|endoftext|>
|0| So, what's happening? Is someone trying to hurt you?<|endoftext|>
|0| No. I'm just scared.<|endoftext|>
|0| Of what?<|endoftext|>
|0| Getting it wrong.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay. Can you pretend like I'm totally a space alien andexplain?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm Merry Gejelh.<|endoftext|>
|0| Really not local. Sorry.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Queen of Years? They chose me when I was a baby, the day thelast Queen of Years died.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm the vessel of our history. I know every chronicle, everypoem, every legend, every song.<|endoftext|>
|0| Every single one? Blimey. I hated history.<|endoftext|>
|0| And now I have to sing a song in front of everyone. A specialsong. I have to sing it to a god. And I'm really scared.<|endoftext|>
|0| Everyone's scared when they're little. I used to be terrified ofgetting lost. Used to have nightmares about it. And then I got lost.Blackpool beach, Bank holiday Monday, about ten billion people. I wasabout six. My worst nightmare come true.<|endoftext|>
|0| What happened?<|endoftext|>
|0| The world ended. My heart broke. And then my mum found me. Wehad fish and chips, and she drove me home and she tucked me up and shetold me a story.<|endoftext|>
|0| It doesn't matter where you are, in the jungle or thedesert or on the moon. However lost you may feel, you'll never reallybe lost. Not really. Because I will always be here, and I will alwayscome and find you. Every single time. Every single time.<|endoftext|>
|0| And you were never scared again?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, I was scared lots of times, but never of being lost. So,this special song. What are you scared of, exactly?<|endoftext|>
|0| Getting it wrong. Making Grandfather angry.<|endoftext|>
|0| And do you think you'll get it wrong? Because I don't. I don'tthink you'll get it wrong. I think you, Merry Gejelh, will get it very,very right.<|endoftext|>
|1| What have you been doing?<|endoftext|>
|0| Exploring. Where are we going now?<|endoftext|>
|0| Sleep, my precious, sleep. Lay down, my warrior. Rest now,my king.<|endoftext|>
|1| Shush, shush. Sorry. Sorry. Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry, sorry.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are we even supposed to be here?<|endoftext|>
|1| Shush.<|endoftext|>
|0| But are we?<|endoftext|>
|1| Shush! Sorry.<|endoftext|>
|0| Akhaten<|endoftext|>
|0| Lay down, my king<|endoftext|>
|0| Sleep now eternal. Sleep, my precious king. Lay down<|endoftext|>
|0| O god of Akhaten<|endoftext|>
|1| They're singing to the Mummy in the Temple. They call it theOld God. Sometimes Grandfather.<|endoftext|>
|0| O god of Akhaten<|endoftext|>
|0| What are they singing?<|endoftext|>
|1| The Long Song. A lullaby without end to feed the Old God. Keephim asleep. It's been going for millions of years, chorister handingover to chorister, generation after generation after generation.<|endoftext|>
|0| What are they doing?<|endoftext|>
|1| Those are offerings. Gifts of value. Mementoes to feed the OldGod.<|endoftext|>
|0| O god of, O god of, O god of Akhaten<|endoftext|>
|0| Sleep, my precious king.<|endoftext|>
|1| Lay, lay down<|endoftext|>
|0| Old God, protect us. Old God, protectus.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, what's happening? Is that supposed to happen?<|endoftext|>
|0| Help!<|endoftext|>
|0| Is somebody going to do something? Excuse me, is somebody goingto help her?<|endoftext|>
|0| Why are we walking away? We can't just walkaway. This is my fault! I talked her into doing this.<|endoftext|>
|1| Listen. There's one thing you need to know about travellingwith me. Well, one thing apart from the blue box and the two hearts. Wedon't walk away.<|endoftext|>
|1| I need something precious.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, you must have something. All the places you've seen, theremust be something.<|endoftext|>
|1| This. And I don't want to give it away, because it comes inhandy.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're a thousand years ole and that's it? Your spanner?<|endoftext|>
|1| Screwdriver.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's my mum's.<|endoftext|>
|0| Merry!<|endoftext|>
|0| Brakes! Brakes!<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay, time to let go.<|endoftext|>
|0| I can't.<|endoftext|>
|1| Clara, you have to.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why?<|endoftext|>
|1| Because it really hurts.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, that's interesting. A frequency modulated acoustic lock.The key changes ten million zillion squillion times a second.<|endoftext|>
|0| Can you open it?<|endoftext|>
|1| Technically, no. In reality, also no, but still, let's give ita stab.<|endoftext|>
|0| Do not wake from slumber. Old God,never wake from slumber.<|endoftext|>
|0| How can they just stand there and watch?<|endoftext|>
|1| Because this is sacred ground.<|endoftext|>
|0| And she's a child.<|endoftext|>
|1| And he's a god. Well, he is to them, anyway.<|endoftext|>
|0| Do not wake from slumber. Old God, do not wake from slumber.Rest your weary, holy head and cast our lives asunder. Do not wake fromslumber.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't know what to do next. What happens?<|endoftext|>
|0| Merry! Merry, hold on! We'll be there soon.Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, yes, yes, yes. Oh, hello.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello what?<|endoftext|>
|1| The sonic's locked on to the acoustic tumblers.<|endoftext|>
|0| Meaning?<|endoftext|>
|1| Meaning I get to do this.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hello there. I'm the Doctor, and you've met Clara. She wassupposed to be having a nice day out. Still, it's early yet. Are youcoming, then? Did I mention that the door is immensely heavy?<|endoftext|>
|0| Leave. You'll wake him.<|endoftext|>
|1| Really quite extraordinarily heavy.<|endoftext|>
|1| Clara?<|endoftext|>
|0| Old God, never wake from slumber.)<|endoftext|>
|0| Merry, we need to leave.<|endoftext|>
|0| No. Go away.<|endoftext|>
|0| Not without you.<|endoftext|>
|0| You said I wouldn't get it wrong and then I got it wrong. Andnow this has happened. Look what happened!<|endoftext|>
|0| You didn't get it wrong.<|endoftext|>
|0| How do you know? You don't know anything. You have to go! Gonow, or he'll eat us all.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, he's ugly. But you know, to be honest, I don't think helooks big enough.<|endoftext|>
|0| Not our meat, our souls.<|endoftext|>
|0| He doesn't want you. He wants me. If you don't leave, he'll eatyou all up too.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, and you don't want that, do you? You want us to walk outof this really quite astonishingly heavy door and never come back.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|1| I see. Right. Clara's right. Absolutely never going to happen.<|endoftext|>
|0| Did you just lock us in with the soul eating monster?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yep.<|endoftext|>
|1| What? Before it eats our souls?<|endoftext|>
|0| Ideally, yes.<|endoftext|>
|1| Possibly. Probably. There usually seems to be.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, why is he still singing?<|endoftext|>
|0| Old God, rest your weary, holy head.<|endoftext|>
|1| He's trying to sing the Old God back to sleep, but that's notgoing to happen. He's waking up, mate. He's coming, ready or not. Youwant to run.<|endoftext|>
|1| That's it, then. Song's over.<|endoftext|>
|0| The song is over. My name is Chorister Rezh Baphix, and theLong Song ended with me.<|endoftext|>
|1| That's it, then. Song's over.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah ha! Look at that.<|endoftext|>
|0| You've woken him.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's awake? What's it doing?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, you know. Having a nice stretch.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, we didn't wake him. And you didn't wake him, either. He'swaking because it's his time to wake, and feed. On you, apparently. Onyour stories.<|endoftext|>
|0| She didn't say stories. She said souls.<|endoftext|>
|1| Same thing. The soul's made of stories, not atoms. Everythingthat ever happened to us. People we love, people we lost. People wefound again against all the odds. He threatens to wake, they offer hima pure soul. The soul of the Queen of Years.<|endoftext|>
|0| Stop it. You're scaring her.<|endoftext|>
|1| Good. She should be scared. She's sacrificing herself. Sheshould know what that means. Do you know what it means, Merry?<|endoftext|>
|0| A god chose me.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's not a god. It'll feed on your soul, but that doesn't makeit a god. It is a vampire, and you don't need to give yourself to it.Hey, do you mind if I tell you a story? One you might not have heard.All the elements in your body were forged many, many millions of yearsago, in the heart of a far away star that exploded and died. Thatexplosion scattered those elements across the desolations of deepspace. After so, so many millions of years, these elements cametogether to form new stars and new planets. And on and on it went. Theelements came together and burst apart, forming shoes and ships andsealing wax, and cabbages and kings. Until eventually, they cametogether to make you. You are unique in the universe. There is only oneMerry Gejelh. And there will never be another. Getting rid of thatexistence isn't a sacrifice. It is a waste.<|endoftext|>
|0| So, if I don't, then everyone else<|endoftext|>
|1| Will be fine.<|endoftext|>
|0| How?<|endoftext|>
|1| There's always a way.<|endoftext|>
|0| You promise?<|endoftext|>
|1| Cross my hearts.<|endoftext|>
|0| Having a nice stretch?<|endoftext|>
|0| Something's coming.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Vigil.<|endoftext|>
|1| And what's the Vigil?<|endoftext|>
|0| If the Queen of Years is unwilling to be feasted upon<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's their job to feed her to Grandfather.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm sorry. I'm sorry.<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't you dare.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, stay back. I'm armed. With a screwdriver.<|endoftext|>
|1| Clara. Sonic.<|endoftext|>
|0| You know all the stories. You must know if there's another wayout.<|endoftext|>
|0| There's a tale. A secret song. The Thief of the Temple and theNimmer's Door.<|endoftext|>
|0| And the secret songs open the secret door? How does it go? Canyou sing it?<|endoftext|>
|1| Go!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|0| Where are you? Where are you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Where did they go?<|endoftext|>
|1| Grandfather's awake. They're of no function any more.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, you could sound happier about it.<|endoftext|>
|1| Actually, I think I may have made a bit of a tactical boo-boo.More of a semantics mix-up, really.<|endoftext|>
|0| What boo-boo?<|endoftext|>
|1| I thought the Old God was Grandfather, but it wasn't. It wasjust Grandfather's alarm clock.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry, a bit lost. Who's the Old God? Is there an Old God?<|endoftext|>
|1| Unfortunately, yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, my stars. What do we do?<|endoftext|>
|1| Against that? I don't know. Do you know? I don't know. Anyideas?<|endoftext|>
|0| But you promised. You promised!<|endoftext|>
|1| I did. I did promise.<|endoftext|>
|0| He'll eat us all. He'll spread across the system, consuming theSeven Worlds. And when there's no more to eat, he'll embark on a newodyssey among the stars.<|endoftext|>
|0| I say leg it.<|endoftext|>
|1| Leg it where, exactly?<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't know. Lake District?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, the Lake District's lovely. Let's definitely go there. Wecan eat scones. They do great scones in 1927.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're going to fight it, aren't you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Regrettably, yes. I think I may be about to do that.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's really big.<|endoftext|>
|1| I've seen bigger.<|endoftext|>
|0| Really?<|endoftext|>
|1| Are you joking? It's massive.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm staying with you.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, you're not.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, I am. I can assist.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, you can't.<|endoftext|>
|0| What about that stuff you said. We don't walk away.<|endoftext|>
|1| No. We don't walk away. But when we're holding on to somethingprecious, we run. We run and run as fast as we can and we don't stoprunning until we are out from under the shadow. Now, off you pop. Takethe moped. I'll walk.<|endoftext|>
|1| Any ideas? No, didn't think so. Righty-ho, then.<|endoftext|>
|1| Lordy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Isn't he frightened?<|endoftext|>
|0| I think he is. I think he's very frightened.<|endoftext|>
|0| I want to help.<|endoftext|>
|0| So do I.<|endoftext|>
|0| Rest now, my warrior. Rest now<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay, then. That's what I'll do. I'll tell you a story.<|endoftext|>
|0| Please, wake up. And let the cloak of life cling to your bones.<|endoftext|>
|1| Can you hear them? All these people who'velived in terror of you and your judgement? All these people whoseancestors devoted themselves, sacrificed themselves, to you. Can youhear them singing? Oh, you like to thing you're a god. But you're not agod. You're just a parasite eaten out with jealousy and envy andlonging for the lives of others. You feed on them. On the memory oflove and loss and birth and death and joy and sorrow. So, come on,then. Take mine. Take my memories. But I hope you've got a bigappetite, because I have lived a long life and I have seen a fewthings.<|endoftext|>
|1| I walked away from the last Great Time War. I marked thepassing of the Time Lords. I saw the birth of the universe and Iwatched as time ran out, moment by moment, until nothing remained. Notime. No space. Just me. I walked in universes where the laws ofphysics were devised by the mind of a mad man. I've watched universesfreeze and creations burn. I've seen things you wouldn't believe. Ihave lost things you will never understand. And I know things. Secretsthat must never be told. Knowledge that must never be spoken. Knowledgethat will make parasite gods blaze. So come on, then. Take it! Take itall, baby! Have it! You have it all!<|endoftext|>
|0| Wake up. Wake up.<|endoftext|>
|0| And I will always come and find you. Every single time.<|endoftext|>
|0| We don't walk away.<|endoftext|>
|0| Still hungry?<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, I brought something for you. This. The most important leafin human history. The most important leaf in human history.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's full of stories, full of history. And full of a future thatnever got lived. Days that should have been that never were. Passed onto me.<|endoftext|>
|0| This leaf isn't just the past, it's a whole future that neverhappened. There are billions and millions of unlived days for every daywe live. An infinity. All the days that never came. And these are allmy mum's.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, come on then. Eat up. Are you full? I expect so, becausethere's quite a difference, isn't there, between what was and whatshould have been. There's an awful lot of one, but there's an infinityof the other.<|endoftext|>
|1| And infinity's too much, even for your appetite.<|endoftext|>
|1| Home again, home again, jiggity jig.<|endoftext|>
|0| It looks different.<|endoftext|>
|1| Nope. Same house, same city, same planet. Hey! Same day,actually. Not bad. Hole in one.<|endoftext|>
|0| You were there. At mum's grave. You were watching. What were youdoing there?<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't know. I was just making sure.<|endoftext|>
|0| Of what?<|endoftext|>
|1| You remind me of someone.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who?<|endoftext|>
|1| Someone who died.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, whoever she was, I'm not her, okay? If you want me totravel with you, that's fine. But as me. I'm not a bargain basementstand-in for someone else. I'm not going to compete with a ghost.<|endoftext|>
|1| No.<|endoftext|>
|1| They wanted you to have it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who did?<|endoftext|>
|1| Everyone. All the people you saved. You. No one else. Clara.<|endoftext|>
|0| Signal is genuine. Signal is genuine. Zero bravo.<|endoftext|>
|0| Prepare to launch nuclear weapons.<|endoftext|>
|0| Aye, sir.<|endoftext|>
|0| Moscow confirming launch sequence.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Firebird stands ready to serve.<|endoftext|>
|0| For the Motherland.<|endoftext|>
|0| For the Motherland.<|endoftext|>
|0| (singing) This means nothing to me. This means nothing to me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, Vienna. Have I interrupted something?<|endoftext|>
|0| We were about to blow up the world, Professor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Again? Ultravox. I bloody love them. Got a friend who sendsme the tapes.<|endoftext|>
|0| This is the Captain. Drill abandoned. All hands, stand down.Repeat, drill abandoned.<|endoftext|>
|0| With respect, sir, we must run it again.<|endoftext|>
|0| Tomorrow.<|endoftext|>
|0| Comrade Captain, the NATO exercises<|endoftext|>
|0| Sabre rattling.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't think so.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, you don't think so?<|endoftext|>
|0| Sir, American aggression gets more intolerable by the day.We must run the drill again.<|endoftext|>
|0| Tomorrow.<|endoftext|>
|0| Did you have your specimen stowed okay?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah. Piotr's looking after it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, at least we have something to show for our little huntingexpedition. What is it, a mammoth?<|endoftext|>
|0| Probably.<|endoftext|>
|0| What are you, milaya moya? Professor wants you thawed out backin Moscow, but life's too short to wait.<|endoftext|>
|0| Argh! Get away!<|endoftext|>
|0| Alarm! Alarm! Hold the bridge, portside.<|endoftext|>
|0| Evasive manoeuvres!<|endoftext|>
|0| Descending to two hundred metres.<|endoftext|>
|0| We're under attack!<|endoftext|>
|0| Two ten!<|endoftext|>
|0| Bring her up! Bring her up!<|endoftext|>
|0| It's no good, sir.<|endoftext|>
|1| Viva Las Vegas!<|endoftext|>
|0| Stranger on the bridge!<|endoftext|>
|0| Who the hell are you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Not Vegas, then.<|endoftext|>
|1| No. No, this is much better.<|endoftext|>
|0| A sinking submarine?<|endoftext|>
|1| A sinking Soviet submarine!<|endoftext|>
|0| Break out side arms. Restrain them!<|endoftext|>
|0| Four ten. Four twenty. Turbines still not responding!<|endoftext|>
|0| They've got to.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah! Sideways momentum. You've still got sideways momentum!<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|1| Your propellers work independently of the main turbines. Youcan't stop her going down but you can manoeuvre the sub laterally. Doit!<|endoftext|>
|0| Get these people off the bridge now!<|endoftext|>
|0| Just listen to him, for god's sake!<|endoftext|>
|1| Geographical anomaly to starboard. Probably an underwaterridge.<|endoftext|>
|0| How do you know this?<|endoftext|>
|1| Look, we have just a chance to stop the descent if we settle onit. Do it!<|endoftext|>
|0| Six hundred metres. Sir, six ten!<|endoftext|>
|1| Or this thing is going to implode.<|endoftext|>
|0| Lateral thrust to starboard, all propellers.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sir?<|endoftext|>
|0| Now!<|endoftext|>
|0| You're going to let this madman give the orders?<|endoftext|>
|0| Lateral thrust!<|endoftext|>
|0| Aye, sir! Six sixty, six eighty.<|endoftext|>
|0| Descent arrested at seven hundred metres.<|endoftext|>
|0| It seems we owe you are lives, whoever you are.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'll hold you to that. Might come in handy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Search them. Yes, I know. It's a woman. Now search them!<|endoftext|>
|0| Are we going to be okay?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Is that a lie?<|endoftext|>
|1| Possibly. Very dangerous time, Clara. East and West standing onthe brink of nuclear oblivion.<|endoftext|>
|1| Lots of itchy fingers on the button.<|endoftext|>
|0| Isn't it always like that?<|endoftext|>
|1| Sort of, but there are flash points and this is one. Hair,shoulder pads, nukes. It's the Eighties. Everything's bigger. I wouldlike a receipt, please.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is this?<|endoftext|>
|1| Clara!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|1| Clara!<|endoftext|>
|1| No! No, no, no, no, no, no. No, not now!<|endoftext|>
|0| Captain, we didn't attack of your ship out here. Now weneed to get the pumps working to get her afloat.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, we'll last till the rescue ship comes.<|endoftext|>
|0| If it comes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, the sinking is just a coincidence, is it? Who are you?<|endoftext|>
|1| All right, Captain, all right. You know what? Just this once,no dissembling, no psychic paper, no pretending to be an EarthAmbassador.<|endoftext|>
|1| Doctor, me and Clara, time travellers. Clara, you okay?<|endoftext|>
|0| Think so.<|endoftext|>
|0| Time travellers?<|endoftext|>
|1| We arrived here out of thin air. You just saw it happen.<|endoftext|>
|0| I didn't.<|endoftext|>
|1| Your problem, mate, not mine.<|endoftext|>
|0| We were sinking.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| What happened?<|endoftext|>
|1| We sank.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, what happened to the Tardis, I mean.<|endoftext|>
|1| Never mind that. Listen. Captain, breath's precious down here.Let's not waste it, eh?<|endoftext|>
|0| You're right. Maybe I can save a little oxygen by having youboth shot!<|endoftext|>
|0| What does it matter how we arrived? The important thing is toget<|endoftext|>
|0| Out.<|endoftext|>
|1| Exactly! Number one priority, not suffocating.<|endoftext|>
|1| Eh? Ah. Oh, thank you. Finally seeing sense. Now, what sort ofstate is the sub in?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| What about the radio? Can we send a<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|1| What!<|endoftext|>
|1| What is that? Gas? Could be gas.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah. It never rains but it pours.<|endoftext|>
|0| We were drilling for oil in the ice. I thought I'd found amammoth.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's not a mammoth.<|endoftext|>
|0| No.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is it, then?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's an Ice Warrior. A native of the planet Mars. And we go wayback. Way back.<|endoftext|>
|0| A Martian? You can't be serious.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm always serious. With days off.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| Just keeping it light, Clara. They're scared.<|endoftext|>
|0| They're scared? I'm scared.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, no, no, no, no, no! Please, please. Wait, just. There is noneed for this. Just hear me out. You're confused, disorientated. Ofcourse you are. You've been lying dormant in the ice for, for, for howlong? How long, Professor?<|endoftext|>
|0| By my reckoning, five thousand years.<|endoftext|>
|1| Five thousand years? That's a hell of a nap. Can't blame you ifyou've got out of the wrong side of bed. Look, nobody here wants tohurt you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Please, just. Why don't you tell us your name?<|endoftext|>
|0| What are you talking about? It has a name?<|endoftext|>
|1| Of course it has a name. And a rank. This is a soldier, and itdeserves our respect.<|endoftext|>
|0| This is madness. That is a monster!<|endoftext|>
|0| Skaldak.<|endoftext|>
|1| What did you say?<|endoftext|>
|0| I am Grand Marshal Skaldak.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, no.<|endoftext|>
|1| You idiot! You idiot. Grand Marshal Skaldak.<|endoftext|>
|0| You know him.<|endoftext|>
|1| Sovereign of the Tharsisian caste. Vanquisher of the PhobosHeresy. The greatest hero the proud Martian race has ever produced.<|endoftext|>
|0| So what do we do now?<|endoftext|>
|1| Lock him up.<|endoftext|>
|0| Is it true?<|endoftext|>
|0| Er, true?<|endoftext|>
|0| I slept for five thousand years?<|endoftext|>
|0| Er, that's what the professor says.<|endoftext|>
|0| Five thousand years.<|endoftext|>
|1| The Ice Warriors have a different creed,Clara. A different code. By his own standards, Skaldak is a hero. Itwas said his enemies honoured him so much, they'd carve his name intotheir own flesh before they died.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, yeah. Very nice. He sounds lovely.<|endoftext|>
|0| An Ice Warrior? Explain.<|endoftext|>
|1| There isn't time.<|endoftext|>
|0| Try me.<|endoftext|>
|1| Martian reptile know as the Ice Warrior. When Mars turned coldthey had to adapt. They're bio-mechaniod. Cyborgs. Built themselvessurvival armour so they could exist in the freezing cold of their homeworld, but a sudden increase in temperature and the armour goeshaywire.<|endoftext|>
|0| Like with the cattle prod thing.<|endoftext|>
|1| Like with the cattle prod thing. Bit of a design flaw. To behonest, I've always wondered why they never sorted it. Oh look, you'vegot me telling you about them and I said there wasn't time.<|endoftext|>
|0| Is he that dangerous?<|endoftext|>
|1| This one is.<|endoftext|>
|0| Find me, my brothers. If you are stillout there, find me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why are we listening to this nonsense, Captain? These peopleare clearly enemy agents.<|endoftext|>
|0| Huh?<|endoftext|>
|0| Spies, Captain.<|endoftext|>
|0| Pretty bad spies, mate. I don't even speak Russian.<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't. (sotto, to the Doctor) Am I speaking Russian? How comeI'm speaking Russian?<|endoftext|>
|1| (sotto) Now? We have to do this now?<|endoftext|>
|0| (sotto) Are they speaking Russian?<|endoftext|>
|1| (sotto) Seriously? Now? It's the Tardis translation matrix.<|endoftext|>
|0| In my opinion, Comrade Captain, this creature is a Westernweapon.<|endoftext|>
|0| (sotto) Are they?<|endoftext|>
|0| A weapon?<|endoftext|>
|0| Survival suit. What is the alternative? The little green manfrom Mars?<|endoftext|>
|0| Correction. It's a big green man from Mars.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't appreciate your levity, Professor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why does that not surprise me? Maybe they're telling thetruth.<|endoftext|>
|0| The truth?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, a revolutionary concept, I know.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's essential that we inform Moscow of what we have found.<|endoftext|>
|0| The radio's out of action, in case you hadn't noticed,Stepashin.<|endoftext|>
|0| They have our last position. They will find us. When they do<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes?<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, the Cold War won't stay cold for ever, Captain.<|endoftext|>
|0| For God's sake, Stepashin, you're like a stuck record. We haveother priorities right now. I want you back on repairs immediately. Weneed to keep this ship alive. Dismissed.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sir?<|endoftext|>
|0| Dismissed, Stepashin.<|endoftext|>
|1| All we needed to do was let Skaldak go and he'd have forgottenus. But you attacked him. You declared war. Harm one of us and you harmus all. That's the ancient Martian code.<|endoftext|>
|1| You hear that? Skaldak has sent out a distress call. He willbring down the fires of hell just for laying a glove on him.<|endoftext|>
|0| Unless you talk to it?<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm the only one who can.<|endoftext|>
|0| No. Out of the question. We're not losing you. I'll do it.<|endoftext|>
|1| What?<|endoftext|>
|0| You can talk to it through me.<|endoftext|>
|1| Skaldak won't talk to you. You're an enemy soldier.<|endoftext|>
|0| And how would he know that?<|endoftext|>
|1| A soldier knows another soldier. He'll smell it on you. Smellit on you a mile off.<|endoftext|>
|0| And he wouldn't smell it on you, Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|1| Just let me in there before it's too late. It can't be you orany of your men.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, it can't be you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ahem. Well, there really is only one choice, isn't there. Idon't smell of anything, to my knowledge.<|endoftext|>
|1| You? No! No! No way. You're not going in there alone, Clara.Absolutely not. No, no. Never.<|endoftext|>
|1| With your permission?<|endoftext|>
|0| Be my guest.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ready, Clara?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay.<|endoftext|>
|0| Grand Marshal Skaldak.<|endoftext|>
|1| The salute.<|endoftext|>
|0| Do the salute like I showed you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay?<|endoftext|>
|1| Good. Good. Now, like we rehearsed.Sovereign of the Tharsisian caste.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sovereign of the Tharsisian caste. By themoons, I honour the.<|endoftext|>
|0| Good. It's okay, Clara. Go closer.<|endoftext|>
|0| Grand Marshal, I'm, we're sorry about this.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's not what you deserve.<|endoftext|>
|0| It isn't what you deserve.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh. Oh, great.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hey, it's okay, Clara. Keep going.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're a long way from home.<|endoftext|>
|1| Five thousand years.<|endoftext|>
|0| And five thousand years adrift in time.<|endoftext|>
|0| Please, let us help you. You are not ourenemy.<|endoftext|>
|0| And yet I am in chains.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, what do I say?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| What should she say?<|endoftext|>
|0| I think he wants to speak to the organ grinder, not to themonkey.<|endoftext|>
|0| I heard that.<|endoftext|>
|1| You are restrained until we can trust eachother, Skaldak. You would do exactly the same in my position, and don'teven think<|endoftext|>
|0| About using that sonic weapon. Not inthe torpedo room.<|endoftext|>
|0| I was Fleet Commander of the Nix Tharsis. My daughter stood byme. It was her first taste of action. We sang the songs of the OldTimes.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Songs of the Red Snow.<|endoftext|>
|0| Five thousand years. Now my daughter willbe dust. Only dust.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, no, no. Listen, your people live on Skaldak.<|endoftext|>
|1| Scattered all across the universe. AndMars will rise again, I promise you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Just let me help you.<|endoftext|>
|0| I require no help.<|endoftext|>
|0| There will be no help.<|endoftext|>
|1| Careful, Clara.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm okay.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, listen, Clara, don't get too close.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm okay. Doctor, something's wrong.<|endoftext|>
|1| What?<|endoftext|>
|0| Something's<|endoftext|>
|0| It's not there. It's gone!<|endoftext|>
|1| Gone? Gone? Gone? What do you mean, gone?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's got out.<|endoftext|>
|0| It is time I learned the measure of my enemies.<|endoftext|>
|0| And what this vessel is capable of.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, no, no. Skaldak!<|endoftext|>
|0| Harm one of us and you harm us all.By the Moons, this I swear.<|endoftext|>
|1| Clara, get out of there. Get out!<|endoftext|>
|1| Now, I've never seen one do this before. Actually, I've neverseen one out of its armour before.<|endoftext|>
|0| Won't it be more vulnerable out of its shell?<|endoftext|>
|1| No, it will be more dangerous.<|endoftext|>
|1| Clara? Clara?<|endoftext|>
|1| Clara! Clara! Clara! Clara!<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm okay. Ha, ha! I'm okay. I'm okay! Where did he go?<|endoftext|>
|0| How did I do? Was I okay?<|endoftext|>
|1| This wasn't a test, Clara.<|endoftext|>
|0| I know, but<|endoftext|>
|1| You were great, yeah.<|endoftext|>
|0| Really?<|endoftext|>
|1| Really.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor? The signal. It's stopped.<|endoftext|>
|1| Skaldak got no answer from his Martian brothers. Now he's givenup hope.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hope of what?<|endoftext|>
|1| Being rescued. He thinks he's been abandoned. He's got nothingleft to lose.<|endoftext|>
|0| But what can he do, stuck down here like the rest of us? Howbad can it be?<|endoftext|>
|1| This sub's stuffed with nuclear missiles, Zhukov. It's fat withthem. What do you think Skaldak's going to do when he finds that out?How bad can it be? How bad can it be? It couldn't be any worse.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay. Spoke to soon.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello? Who's there? Who's there? Who'sthere!<|endoftext|>
|0| What do you want with me?<|endoftext|>
|0| Much.<|endoftext|>
|0| Comrades, you know our situation. Thereactor is drowned. We are totally reliant on battery power and our airis running out. Rescue is unlikely, but we still have a mission tofulfil. If the Doctor is right, then we are all that stands betweenthis creature and the destruction of the world. Control of one missileis all he needs. We are expendable, comrades. Our world is not. I knowI can rely on every one of you to do his duty without fail. That isall.<|endoftext|>
|0| Listen to me. We both understand eachother. This, this mewling time of peace, it doesn't suit us. We areboth warriors, and together we can form an alliance.<|endoftext|>
|0| An alliance?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes. To win the Cold War.<|endoftext|>
|0| Cold War?<|endoftext|>
|0| Both sides are capable of completely obliterating the other.It's a state we call mutually assured destruction.<|endoftext|>
|0| Mutually assured destruction. But this has not occured.<|endoftext|>
|0| No.<|endoftext|>
|0| Not yet.<|endoftext|>
|0| Even if a missile did get launched, thatwouldn't be it, would it?<|endoftext|>
|1| It?<|endoftext|>
|0| End of the world. Game over. I mean, what if they fired one byaccident. What would happen then?<|endoftext|>
|1| I told you, Clara. Earth is like a storm waiting to break,right now. Both sides baring their teeth, talking up war. It would onlytake one tiny spark.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, but the world didn't end in 1983, did it, or I wouldn't behere.<|endoftext|>
|1| New. History's in flux. It can be changed. Re-written.<|endoftext|>
|1| How many of us are left?<|endoftext|>
|0| Twelve. And we can't find Stepashin.<|endoftext|>
|1| We split up and comb this sub. One team stays here to guard thebridge.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's it? That's the plan?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, it's either that or we stay here and wait for him to killus.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay.<|endoftext|>
|0| Is it true you've never seen one outside of its shell suit?<|endoftext|>
|1| Shell suit? Clara! For an Ice Warrior to leave its armour isthe gravest dishonour. Skaldak is desperate. He is deadly and we havegot to find him.<|endoftext|>
|0| Will this help?<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah! You saved it.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, no, it was on the floor with this.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah, Professor, I could kiss you.<|endoftext|>
|0| If you insist.<|endoftext|>
|1| Later.<|endoftext|>
|0| Do you think it's true, sir? A Martian?<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't know what to think.<|endoftext|>
|0| So, why have you got a cattle prod on asubmarine?<|endoftext|>
|0| Polar bears.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ah, right.<|endoftext|>
|0| We run across them when we're drilling. Can be quite nasty,you know.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'd swap one for an Ice Warrior any day. Cuddlier.<|endoftext|>
|0| Courage, my dear. I always sing a song.<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|0| To keep my spirits up.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, that would work, if this was Pinocchio.<|endoftext|>
|0| Do you know Hungry Like The Wolf?<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|0| Duran Duran. One of my favourites. Come on.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm not singing a song.<|endoftext|>
|0| What was that?<|endoftext|>
|1| Pressure. Just pressure. We're seven hundred metres down,remember?<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't worry about it. Think of something else.<|endoftext|>
|0| I am hungry like the wolf.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm not singing.<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't you know it?<|endoftext|>
|0| Course I know it. We do it at karaoke, the odd hen night.<|endoftext|>
|0| Karaoke? Hen night? You speak excellent Russian, my dear, butsometimes I don't understand a word you're talking about.<|endoftext|>
|0| If we get out of here, we'll be bloodyheroes.<|endoftext|>
|0| If we get out of here.<|endoftext|>
|0| The first people in the world to discover a genuine, living<|endoftext|>
|0| Alien?<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't know. You hear stories, don't you. Stories about thethings the Kremlin doesn't want us to<|endoftext|>
|0| Onegin? Onegin!<|endoftext|>
|0| Good God. Torn apart. It's a monster, a savage.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, Professor. Not savage. Forensic. Well, he's dismantledthem. Skaldak's learning. Learning all about you. Your strengths, yourweaknesses. Come on.<|endoftext|>
|1| Stay here.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay.<|endoftext|>
|1| Stay here. Don't argue.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm not.<|endoftext|>
|1| Right. Good.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, it's a young man's game, all this dashing about. Clara,what is it?<|endoftext|>
|0| I was doing okay. I mean, I went in there and I did the scarystuff, didn't I? I went in there with the Ice Warrior and it went okay.Actually, it went just about as badly as it could have done but thatwasn't my fault.<|endoftext|>
|0| Not at all.<|endoftext|>
|0| So I'm happy about that.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Chuffed.<|endoftext|>
|0| And so you should be. So what's the matter?<|endoftext|>
|0| Seeing those bodies back there. It's all got very real. Are wegoing to make it?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, of course.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's in the walls.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, Stepashin.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, oh, oh. Fast. He's fast.<|endoftext|>
|0| What was that?<|endoftext|>
|0| The Doctor told you, it's just the boat settling. Tell meabout yourself. What do you like doing? Clara? Clara?<|endoftext|>
|0| Stuff. You know, stuff.<|endoftext|>
|0| Stuff. Very enlightening. And the Doctor, what he said. Is ittrue you're from another time? From our future? Clara?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Tell me what happens.<|endoftext|>
|0| I can't.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, I need to know.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm not allowed.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, please.<|endoftext|>
|0| I can't!<|endoftext|>
|0| Ultravox, do they split up?<|endoftext|>
|0| Funny. You're funny.<|endoftext|>
|0| Let her go!<|endoftext|>
|0| See? I don't just like Western music<|endoftext|>
|0| No, please don't hurt him. Please!<|endoftext|>
|0| You attacked me. Martian law decrees that the people of thisplanet are forfeit. I now have all the information I require. It willtake only one missile to begin the process. To end this Cold War.<|endoftext|>
|1| Grand Marshal, there is no need for this. Listen to me.<|endoftext|>
|0| My distress call has not been answered. It will never beanswered. My people are dead. They are dust. There is nothing left forme except my revenge.<|endoftext|>
|1| There is something left for you, Skaldak. Mercy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Mercy?<|endoftext|>
|0| You must wear that armour for a reason, my friend. Let's see,shall we?<|endoftext|>
|1| No, Captain, wait!<|endoftext|>
|0| I will do whatever it takes to defend my world, Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, great, fine, good, but we are getting somewhere here. Weare negotiating. Jaw-jaw not war-war.<|endoftext|>
|0| Churchill?<|endoftext|>
|1| Churchill.<|endoftext|>
|0| Very well, we'll negotiate, but from a position of strength.<|endoftext|>
|0| Excellent tactical thinking. My congratulations, Captain.<|endoftext|>
|0| Thank you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Unfortunately, your position is not, perhaps, as strong as youmight hope.<|endoftext|>
|1| What do you mean?<|endoftext|>
|1| He summoned the armour.<|endoftext|>
|0| How did it do that?<|endoftext|>
|1| Sonic tech, Clara. The song of the Ice Warrior.<|endoftext|>
|1| No!<|endoftext|>
|0| My world is dead but now there will be a second red planet.Red with the blood of humanity!<|endoftext|>
|1| Skaldak! Skaldak, wait!<|endoftext|>
|1| No! Skaldak, wait! Wait, wait.<|endoftext|>
|0| He's arming the warheads.<|endoftext|>
|1| Where is the honour in condemning billions of innocents todeath? Five thousand years ago Mars was the centre of a vast empire.The jewel of this solar system. The people of Earth had only just begunto leave their caves. Five thousand years isn't such a long time.They're still just frightened children, still primitive. Who are you tojudge them?<|endoftext|>
|0| I am Skaldak! This planet is forfeit under Martian law.<|endoftext|>
|1| Then teach them. Teach them, Grand Marshal. Show them anotherway. Show them there is honour in mercy. Is this how you want historyto remember you? Grand Marshal Skaldak, Destroyer of Earth. Becausethat's what you'll be if you send those missiles. Not a soldier, amurderer. Five billion lives extinguished. No chance for goodbyes. Aworld snuffed out like a candle flame! All right. All right, Skaldak,you leave me no choice. I'm a Time Lord, Skaldak. I know a thing or twoabout sonic technology myself.<|endoftext|>
|0| A threat? You threaten me, Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|1| No. No, not you, all of us. I will blow this sub up before youcan even reach that button, Grand Marshal. Blow us all to oblivion.<|endoftext|>
|0| You would sacrifice yourself?<|endoftext|>
|1| In a heartbeat.<|endoftext|>
|0| Mutually assured destruction.<|endoftext|>
|1| Look into my eyes, Skaldak. Look into my eyes and tell meyou're capable of doing this. Huh? Can you do that? Dare you do that?Look into my eyes, Skaldak. Come on. Face to face.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Which of us shall blink first?<|endoftext|>
|0| Why did you hesitate? Back there, in the dark. You were going tokill this man, remember? I begged you not to, and you listened. Whyshow compassion then, Skaldak, and not now? The Doctor's right.Billions will die. Mothers, sons, fathers, daughters. Remember thatlast battle, Skaldak? Your daughter. You sang the songs.<|endoftext|>
|0| Of the Red Snows.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's happening?<|endoftext|>
|0| My people live. They have come for me!<|endoftext|>
|0| We're rising. We're rising!<|endoftext|>
|0| Six hundred metres. Five fifty.<|endoftext|>
|1| We've surfaced. Your people have saved us.<|endoftext|>
|0| Saved me, not you.<|endoftext|>
|1| Just go, Skaldak, please. Please, go in peace.<|endoftext|>
|0| We did it. We did it!<|endoftext|>
|1| No. No, no, no, no, no. It's still armed. A single pulse fromthat ship. I'll destroy us if I have to. I will destroy us if I haveto. Show mercy, Skaldak. Come on. Show mercy.<|endoftext|>
|0| (sings) I'm lost and I'm found, and I'm hungry like the wolf.<|endoftext|>
|1| Now we're safe.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ahem. Saved the world, then?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's what we do.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Tardis! Where's the Tardis? You never explained.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh well, don't worry about that.<|endoftext|>
|0| Stop saying that. Where is it?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah. Well, I wasn't to know, was I?<|endoftext|>
|0| Know what?<|endoftext|>
|1| I've been tinkering, breaking her in. I'm allowed.<|endoftext|>
|0| What did you do?<|endoftext|>
|1| (sotto) I reset the HADS.<|endoftext|>
|0| Huh?<|endoftext|>
|1| I reset the HADS.<|endoftext|>
|0| The what?<|endoftext|>
|1| The HADS. The Hostile Action Displacement System. If the Tardiscomes under attack, gunfire, time winds, the sea, it relocates.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| Haven't used it in donkey's years. It seemed like a good ideaat the time. Well, never mind, it's bound to turn up somewhere.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ooo. Ha, see? Right on cue. Brilliant.<|endoftext|>
|0| Brilliant.<|endoftext|>
|1| The Tardis is at the pole.<|endoftext|>
|0| Not far, then.<|endoftext|>
|1| The south pole.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ah.<|endoftext|>
|1| Could we have a lift?<|endoftext|>
|0| How are we looking?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, about ready, I think.<|endoftext|>
|0| Any thoughts on the interference?<|endoftext|>
|0| Er, a stray FM broadcast, possibly. I've fitted some ferritesuppressors and some RF chokes, just in case. Are you sure you want togo through with this? I mean, the last time, it was very<|endoftext|>
|0| But she's so lonely.<|endoftext|>
|0| Excellent, then. Excellent. (into microphone) Caliburn House,night four, November 25th, 1974. 11.04 pm.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm talking to the spirit that inhabits this house. Are youthere? Can you hear me? I'm speaking to the lost soul that abides inthis place.<|endoftext|>
|0| Come to me. Speak to me. Let me show you the way home.<|endoftext|>
|0| Let me show you the way home!<|endoftext|>
|0| Emma?<|endoftext|>
|0| She's so<|endoftext|>
|0| So what?<|endoftext|>
|0| Dead.<|endoftext|>
|1| Boo! Hello, I'm looking for a ghost.<|endoftext|>
|0| And you are?<|endoftext|>
|0| Ghostbusters.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm the Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor what?<|endoftext|>
|1| If you like. And this is Clara.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah, but you are very different. You are Major Alec Palmer.Member of the Baker Street Irregulars, the Ministry of UngentlemanlyWarfare. Specialised in espionage, sabotage and reconnaissance behindenemy lines. You're a talented watercolourist, professor of psychologyand ghost hunter. Total pleasure. Massive.<|endoftext|>
|0| Actually, you're wrong. Professor Palmer spent most of the war asa POW.<|endoftext|>
|1| Actually, that's a like told by a very brave man involved invery secret operations. The type of man who keeps a Victoria Cross in abox in the attic, eh? But you know that, because you're Emma Grayling,the Professor's companion.<|endoftext|>
|0| Assistant.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's 1974. You're the assistant and non-objective equipment.Meaning psychic.<|endoftext|>
|0| Getting that. Bless you, though.<|endoftext|>
|0| Relax, Emma. He's Military Intelligence. So, what is all thisin aid of?<|endoftext|>
|1| Health and safety. Yeah, the Ministry got wind of what's goingon down here. Sent me to check that everything's in order.<|endoftext|>
|0| They don't have the right.<|endoftext|>
|1| Don't worry, guv'nor, I'll be out of your hair in five minutes.Oh! Oh, look. Oh, lovely. The ACR 99821. Oh, bliss. Nice action on thetoggle switches. You know, I do love a toggle switch. Actually, I likethe word toggle. Nice noun. Excellent verb. Oi, don't mess with thesettings.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's that?<|endoftext|>
|1| Gadget. Health and safety. Classified, I'm afraid. You know,while the back room boffins work out a few kinks.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's it telling you?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's telling me that you haven't been exposed to anylife-threatening transmundane emanations. So, where's the ghost? Showme the ghost. It's ghost time.<|endoftext|>
|0| I will not have this stolen out from under me, do youunderstand.<|endoftext|>
|1| Er, no, not really, sorry.<|endoftext|>
|0| I will not have my work stolen, then be fobbed off with a paton the back and a letter from the Queen. Never again. This is my house,Doctor, and it belongs to me.<|endoftext|>
|0| This is actually your house?<|endoftext|>
|0| It is.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry. You went to the bank and said, you know that gigantic oldhaunted house on the moors? The one the dossers are too scared to dossin? The one the birds are too scared to fly over? And then you said,I'd like to buy it, please, with my money.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, I did, actually.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's incredibly brave.<|endoftext|>
|1| Listen, Major, we just need to know what's going on here.<|endoftext|>
|0| For the Ministry.<|endoftext|>
|1| You know I can't answer that.<|endoftext|>
|0| Very well, follow me.<|endoftext|>
|0| So, what's an empathic psychic?<|endoftext|>
|0| Sometimes I sense feelings, the way a telepath can sensethoughts. Sometimes, though. Not always.<|endoftext|>
|1| The most compassionate people you'll ever meet, empathics. Andthe loneliest. I mean, exposing themselves to all those hiddenfeelings, all that guilt, pain and sorrow and<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes?<|endoftext|>
|0| Shush.<|endoftext|>
|0| Would you care to have a look?<|endoftext|>
|0| Caliburn House is over four hundred years old, but she has beenhere much longer. The Caliburn Ghast.<|endoftext|>
|0| She's mentioned in local Saxon poetry and parish folk tales.The Wraith of the Lady, the Maiden in the Dark, the Witch of the Well.<|endoftext|>
|0| Is she real? As in, actually real?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, she's real. In the seventeenth century, a local clergymansaw her. He wrote that her presence was accompanied by a dreadfulknocking, as if the Devil himself demanded entry. During the war,American airmen stationed here left offerings of tinned Spam. The tinswere found in 1965, bricked up in the servants' pantry, along with anumber of handwritten notes. Appeals to the Ghast. For the love of God,stop screaming.<|endoftext|>
|0| She never changes. The angle's different, the framing, but she'salways in exactly the same position. Why is that?<|endoftext|>
|0| We don't know. She's an objective phenomenon, but objectiverecording equipment can't detect her<|endoftext|>
|1| Without the presence of a powerful psychic.<|endoftext|>
|0| Absolutely. Very well done.<|endoftext|>
|0| She knows I'm here. I can feel her calling out to me.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's she saying?<|endoftext|>
|0| Help me.<|endoftext|>
|1| The Witch of the Well. So where's the well?<|endoftext|>
|0| A copy of the oldest plan that we could find. There is no wellon the property. None that we could find, anyway.<|endoftext|>
|1| (sotto) You coming?<|endoftext|>
|0| (sotto) Where?<|endoftext|>
|1| (sotto) To find the ghost.<|endoftext|>
|0| (sotto) Why would I want to do that?<|endoftext|>
|1| (sotto) Because you want to. Come on.<|endoftext|>
|0| (sotto) Well, I dispute that assertion.<|endoftext|>
|1| (sotto) Eh? I'm giving you a face. Can you see me? Look at myface.<|endoftext|>
|0| (sotto) Fine. Dare me.<|endoftext|>
|1| I dare you. No takesies backsies.<|endoftext|>
|0| The music room is the heart of the house.<|endoftext|>
|0| Say we actually find her. What do we say?<|endoftext|>
|1| We ask her how she came to be whatever she is.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why?<|endoftext|>
|1| Because I don't know, and ignorance is, what's the opposite ofbliss?<|endoftext|>
|0| Carlisle.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes. Yes, Carlisle. Ignorance is Carlisle.<|endoftext|>
|0| Is he really from the Ministry?<|endoftext|>
|0| Er, I don't know. He's certainly got the right demeanour.Capricious, brilliant.<|endoftext|>
|0| Deceitful.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes. Ha. He's a liar. But, you know, that's often the way thatit is when someone's seen a thing or two. Experience makes liars of usall. We lie about who we are, about what we've done.<|endoftext|>
|0| And how we feel?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes. Always. Always that. You know, I have to, have to begetting on with things. The er, the equipment and so forth.<|endoftext|>
|0| Of course.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah, the music room. The heart of the house. Do you feelanything?<|endoftext|>
|0| No.<|endoftext|>
|1| Your pants are so on fire.<|endoftext|>
|0| (sotto) Do you feel like you're being watched?<|endoftext|>
|1| (sotto) What does being watched feel like? Is it that funnytickly feeling on the back of your neck?<|endoftext|>
|0| (sotto) That's the chap.<|endoftext|>
|1| (sotto) Then yes, a bit. Well, quite a big bit.<|endoftext|>
|0| I think she's here.<|endoftext|>
|1| Cold spot. Spooky. Cold. Warm. Cold. Warm. Cold. Warm. Cold.Warm. Cold.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor? Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|1| What?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm not happy.<|endoftext|>
|1| No.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hey!<|endoftext|>
|0| What was that?<|endoftext|>
|0| Does it seem colder?<|endoftext|>
|0| She's coming.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, what is that?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's a very loud noise. It's a very loud, very angry noise.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's making it?<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't know. Are you making it?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes?<|endoftext|>
|0| I may be a teeny, tiny bit terrified.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes?<|endoftext|>
|0| But I'm still a grown-up.<|endoftext|>
|1| Mainly, yes, and?<|endoftext|>
|0| There's no need to actually hold my hand.<|endoftext|>
|1| Clara.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah?<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm not holding your hand.<|endoftext|>
|1| Has this happened before?<|endoftext|>
|0| Never.<|endoftext|>
|1| Camera. Camera!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|0| Help me!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Urgh. I'd rather have a nice cup of tea.<|endoftext|>
|0| Me too. Whisky is the eleventh most disgusting thing everinvented.<|endoftext|>
|1| I had a little peek at your records, back at the Ministry.You've certainly seen a thing or two in your time. Disrupting U-boatoperations across the North Sea, sabotaging railway lines acrossEurope. Operation Gibbon. The one with the carrier pigeons, brilliant.I do love a carrier pigeon.<|endoftext|>
|0| I did my duty, but then so did thousands of others. Millions ofothers. I was just lucky enough to come back.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, but how does that man, that war hero, end up here in alonely old house, looking for ghosts?<|endoftext|>
|0| Because I killed, and I caused to have killed. I sent young menand women to their deaths, but here I am, still alive and it does tendto haunt you. Living, after so much of the other thing.<|endoftext|>
|0| So, you and Professor Palmer, have youever, you know?<|endoftext|>
|0| No.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why not? You do know how he feels about you, don't you? You, ofall people?<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't know. People like me, sometimes we get our signals mixedup. We think people are feeling the way we want them to feel, you know,when they are special to us, when really there's nothing there.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, this is there.<|endoftext|>
|0| How do you know?<|endoftext|>
|0| Because it's obvious. It sticks out like a big chin.<|endoftext|>
|0| You see, I was alone and unmarried and Ididn't mind dying. I mean, not for that cause. It was a very, very finecause, defeating the enemy.<|endoftext|>
|1| And if you could contact them, what would you say?<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, I'd very much like to thank them.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah ha. Ping!<|endoftext|>
|0| Who do you think she is?<|endoftext|>
|1| Not what I thought she'd be.<|endoftext|>
|0| What did you think she's be?<|endoftext|>
|1| Fun. Can I borrow your camera? Ta.<|endoftext|>
|0| What about you and the Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, I don't think so.<|endoftext|>
|0| Good.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry?<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't trust him. There's a sliver of ice in his heart.<|endoftext|>
|0| Clara!<|endoftext|>
|0| (sotto) I've got this weird feeling it's looking at me. Itdoesn't like me.<|endoftext|>
|1| The Tardis is like a cat. A bit slow to trust, but you'll getthere in the end.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hey. You need a place to keep this.<|endoftext|>
|1| I've got one. Or I had one. I think I had one. Look around. Seeif you find it. Did I have one? Am I going mad?<|endoftext|>
|1| No, not in here. How do you expect her to like you? She'ssoaking wet. It's a health and safety nightmare.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sorry. So, where are we going?<|endoftext|>
|1| Nowhere. We're staying right here. Right here, on this exactspot, if I can work out how to do it.<|endoftext|>
|0| So, when are we going?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, that is good. That is top-notch.<|endoftext|>
|0| And the answer is?<|endoftext|>
|1| We're going always.<|endoftext|>
|0| We're going always.<|endoftext|>
|1| Totally.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's not actually a sentence.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, it's got a verb in it. What do you think?<|endoftext|>
|0| Colour's a bit boisterous.<|endoftext|>
|1| I think it brings out my eyes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Makes my eyes hurt.<|endoftext|>
|0| Did you see where he went? I could hear an engine but I can'tsee any lights.<|endoftext|>
|1| Back off. Hot suit. Hot, hot, hot.<|endoftext|>
|0| When are we?<|endoftext|>
|1| About six billion years ago. It's a Tuesday, I think.<|endoftext|>
|1| Back in a mo. Are you all right?<|endoftext|>
|0| Totally. Peachy keen.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay then. Well, don't press any buttons or pull any levers ormake any funny faces. Actually, don't move. Stand completely still.Don't breathe. Well, you can breathe, but shallow breaths.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh. What's wrong? Did the Tardis say something to you? Are youbeing mean?<|endoftext|>
|0| No, it's not that. Have we just watched the entire life cycle ofEarth, birth to death?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| And you're okay with that?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| How can you be?<|endoftext|>
|1| The Tardis, she's time. We. Wibbly vortex and so on.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's not what I mean.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay, some help. Context? Cheat sheet? Something?<|endoftext|>
|0| I mean, one minute you're in 1974 looking for ghosts, but allyou have to do is open your eyes and talk to whoever's standing there.To you, I haven't been born yet, and to you I've been dead one hundredbillion years. Is my body out there somewhere, in the ground?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, I suppose it is.<|endoftext|>
|0| But here we are, talking. So I am a ghost. To you, I'm a ghost.We're all ghosts to you. We must be nothing.<|endoftext|>
|1| No. No. You're not that.<|endoftext|>
|0| Then what are we? What can we possibly be?<|endoftext|>
|1| You are the only mystery worth solving.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's wrong?<|endoftext|>
|0| I just saw something I wish I hadn't.<|endoftext|>
|0| What did you see?<|endoftext|>
|0| That everything ends.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, not everything. Not love. Not always.<|endoftext|>
|1| Right, done. That's it. Gather round, gather round. Roll up,roll up.<|endoftext|>
|1| The Ghast of Caliburn House. Never changing, trapped in amoment of fear and torment. But, what if she's not? What if she's justtrapped somewhere time runs more slowly than it does here? What if asecond to her was a hundred thousand years to us? And what if somebodyhas a magic box. A blue box, probably. What if said somebody could takea snapshot of her, say, every few million years?<|endoftext|>
|1| She's not a ghost. But she's definitely a lost soul. Her nameis Hila Tacorian. She's a pioneer, a time traveller, or at least shewill be in a few hundred years.<|endoftext|>
|0| Time travel's not possible. The paradoxes<|endoftext|>
|1| Resolve themselves, by and large.<|endoftext|>
|0| How long has she been alone?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, time travel's a funny old thing. I mean, from herperspective, she crash landed three minutes ago.<|endoftext|>
|0| Crash landed? Where?<|endoftext|>
|1| She's in a pocket universe. A distorted echo of our own. Theyhappen sometimes but never last for long.<|endoftext|>
|0| But what's she running from?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, that's the best bit. We don't know yet. Shall we see?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is that?<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't know. Still, not to worry.<|endoftext|>
|0| So, what do we do?<|endoftext|>
|1| Not we, you. You save Hila Tacorian because you are EmmaGrayling. You are the lantern. The rest of us are just along for theride, I'm afraid. We need some sturdy rope and a blue crystal fromMetebelis Three. Plus some Kendal Mint Cake.<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't do it.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm sorry?<|endoftext|>
|0| Nobody asked her to risk her life. This woman, she doesn'tdeserve. Whoever she is, however brilliant, however brave, she's notyou. She is not worth risking a single hair on your head. Not to me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Tell me what I'm thinking.<|endoftext|>
|0| I can't. I don't have your gift.<|endoftext|>
|0| You don't need it. Just look at me and tell me.<|endoftext|>
|0| There you are, you read my mind.<|endoftext|>
|0| Can't you just, you know?<|endoftext|>
|1| What?<|endoftext|>
|0| Fly the Tardis into the parallel universe?<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah, it's not a parallel universe. It's a pocket universe. Plus,it is collapsing. I mean, the Tardis could get in there all right, butentropy would bleed her power sources, you see? Trap her there untilthe entire universe decayed back into the quantum foam. Which wouldtake about three minutes, give or take, you know.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is that?<|endoftext|>
|1| A subset of the Eye of Harmony.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't<|endoftext|>
|1| Of course you don't. Be weird if you did. I barely do myself.Right. You, sit down. All the way from Metebelis Three.<|endoftext|>
|0| What does it do?<|endoftext|>
|1| It amplifies your natural abilities like a microphone, or apooper scooper.<|endoftext|>
|0| What exactly is this arrangement?<|endoftext|>
|1| A psychochronograph.<|endoftext|>
|0| Forgive me, but isn't it all a bit well, make do and mend?<|endoftext|>
|1| Non-psychic technology won't work where I'm going. Listen, allI need to do is dive into another dimension, find the time traveller,help her escape the monster. get home before the entire dimensioncollapses and Bob's your uncle.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, will it hurt?<|endoftext|>
|1| No. Well, yes. Probably. A bit. Well, quite a lot. I don'tknow. It might be agony. To be perfectly honest, I'll be interested tofind out.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm talking to the lost soul that abides in this place. I'mspeaking to Hila Tarcorian.<|endoftext|>
|1| See? The Witch of the Well! It's a wormhole! A reality well! Adoor to the echo universe. Ready?<|endoftext|>
|0| Ready!<|endoftext|>
|1| Geronimo.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|1| Hila? Hila! Hila Tacorian!<|endoftext|>
|1| One, two, three.<|endoftext|>
|0| Help me! Help!<|endoftext|>
|1| Hila Tacorian, I presume.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who are you?<|endoftext|>
|1| Collapsing universe. You and me, dead, two minutes. No timecomplete sentences. Abandon planet.<|endoftext|>
|0| Wait. There's something in the mist.<|endoftext|>
|1| Then run. Run!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor! Doctor! Come home! Doctor, come home!<|endoftext|>
|1| Not that way, which means, er, probably.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's wrong?<|endoftext|>
|1| You know that exit I mentioned?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes?<|endoftext|>
|1| I seem to have misplaced it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|1| This way.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor! Come home!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, we're here.<|endoftext|>
|1| Whoa.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's that?<|endoftext|>
|1| An echo house, in an echo universe. Clever psychic. That isjust top-notch.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor! Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|1| It's looking for a way in.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm not strong enough!<|endoftext|>
|0| Just a few more seconds.<|endoftext|>
|1| Grab the rope. Give it three tugs, quickas you like.<|endoftext|>
|0| What about you?<|endoftext|>
|1| I'll be next.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, that's what that noise was. Lovely.<|endoftext|>
|0| No!<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh dear.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh dear. Where are you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Wake up! Wake up! Open the thing.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm sorry.<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't be sorry. Don't be. What you did<|endoftext|>
|0| Wasn't enough. She needs to do it again.<|endoftext|>
|0| She can't. Look at her.<|endoftext|>
|0| She has to! We can't leave him.<|endoftext|>
|0| I know that you feel you can't do this, Emma, but look at thatwoman over there. You saved her. She's only here because of yourstrength, and so am I.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, come on! Let me in, you grumpy old cow!<|endoftext|>
|0| Whoa.<|endoftext|>
|0| I was as lost as her, but being with you,you gave me a reason to be, Emma. You brought me back from the dead.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's this now?<|endoftext|>
|0| The Tardis Voice Visual Interface. I'm programmed to selectthe image of a person you esteem. Of several billion such images in mydatabanks, this one best meets the criterion.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh. Oh, you are a cow. I knew it. Whatever. You have to help theDoctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Doctor is in the pocket universe.<|endoftext|>
|0| You can enter the pocket universe.<|endoftext|>
|0| The entropy would drain the energy from my heart. In fourseconds, I'd be stranded. In ten, I'd be dead.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're talking, but all I hear is muh muh muh. Come on, let'sgo.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hey, hey, hey!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Can you hear me? Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, come on.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, can you hear me?<|endoftext|>
|0| Ah! Whoa!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, we're here. Come home.<|endoftext|>
|1| Emma?<|endoftext|>
|1| What do you want? To frighten me, I suppose, eh? Because that'swhat you do. You hide. You're the bogeyman under the bed, seeking whomyou may devour.<|endoftext|>
|1| You want me to be afraid. Then well done. I am the Doctor, andI am afraid.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, hurry!<|endoftext|>
|1| So why am I still here, huh? Why not justeat me? Ha? Come on. Because you still need me.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, you need me to piggyback you across. To which I say, comeon then, big boy, chase me.<|endoftext|>
|0| You wanted a word?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, if that's<|endoftext|>
|0| That's fine. You didn't come here for the ghost, did you?<|endoftext|>
|1| No.<|endoftext|>
|0| You came here for me.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why?<|endoftext|>
|1| I needed to ask you something.<|endoftext|>
|0| Then ask.<|endoftext|>
|1| Clara.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes?<|endoftext|>
|1| What is she?<|endoftext|>
|0| She's a girl.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, but what kind of girl, specifically?<|endoftext|>
|0| She's a perfectly ordinary girl. Very pretty, very clever, morescared than she lets on.<|endoftext|>
|1| And that's it, is it?<|endoftext|>
|0| Why? Is that not enough?<|endoftext|>
|0| Where will you go?<|endoftext|>
|0| He can't take me home. History says I went missing.<|endoftext|>
|0| But he can change history.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, no, no, I can't, actually. There are fixed points in time,you see<|endoftext|>
|0| Hi.<|endoftext|>
|1| What?<|endoftext|>
|0| I knew you were there. I could feel you.<|endoftext|>
|0| I know.<|endoftext|>
|0| Have we?<|endoftext|>
|0| We can't have. You haven't even been born yet.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, you can't have met but she can be your great, great, great,great, great granddaughter. Yours too, of course. But you guessed thatalready, didn't you. Oh. Apparently not.<|endoftext|>
|0| The paradoxes<|endoftext|>
|1| Resolve themselves, by and large. That's why the psychic linkwas so powerful. Blood calling to blood, out of time. Not everythingends. Not love. Not always.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, what about, what about us? Emma and me?<|endoftext|>
|1| What about you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, what's supposed to happen? I mean, what do we do now?<|endoftext|>
|1| Hold hands. That's what you're meant to do. Keep doing that anddon't let go. That's the secret.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor! I'm not happy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, you need me to piggyback you across.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm not holding your hand.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, I'm so slow! I am slow. I'm notorious for it. That's alwaysbeen my problem. But, but I get there in the end. Oh yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|1| How do sharks make babies?<|endoftext|>
|0| Carefully?<|endoftext|>
|1| No, no, no. Happily!<|endoftext|>
|0| Sharks don't actually smile. They're just, well, they've gotlots and lots of teeth. They're quite eaty.<|endoftext|>
|1| Exactly. But birds do it, bees do it, even educated fleas doit. Every lonely monster needs a companion.<|endoftext|>
|0| There's two of them?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's the oldest story in the universe, this one or any other.Boy and girl fall in love, get separated by events. War, politics,accidents in time. She's thrown out of the hex, or he's thrown into it.Since then they've been yearning for each other across time and space,across dimensions. This isn't a ghost story, it's a love story!<|endoftext|>
|1| Sorry.<|endoftext|>
|1| Excuse me. Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt the rest of your life.So. Tiny favour to ask.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm sorry! I understand now! I can takeyou to her! I can take you to a safe place far away from here! You canbe together! Well, come on, then. She's waiting!<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, hello again, you old Romeo, you. Now, here she comes.<|endoftext|>
|1| Get ready to jump.<|endoftext|>
|0| Incoming salvage. Please validate. Incoming salvage. Pleasevalidate. Incoming salvage. Please validate.<|endoftext|>
|0| Rusty garbage. It's not worth lacing up my boots.<|endoftext|>
|0| Wasting our time. There's no salvage this far out.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're a lucky boy, Tricky. You're an android. You don't getbored.<|endoftext|>
|0| He won't turn back. Not with half a cargo.<|endoftext|>
|0| He's not captain. We're equal partners.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah. Right.<|endoftext|>
|1| You said<|endoftext|>
|0| I know what I said. I was the one who said it.<|endoftext|>
|1| You said it was looking at you funny.<|endoftext|>
|0| I was tired, overwrought. I didn't mean it. It's an appliance.It does a job.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's a pretty cool appliance. We're not talking cheese graterhere.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're not getting me to talk to your ship. That's properlybonkers.<|endoftext|>
|1| (to console) It's okay, it's okay.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're like one of those guys who can't go out with a girlunless his mother approves.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's important to me you get along. I could leave you two alonetogether.<|endoftext|>
|0| Now you're creeping me out.<|endoftext|>
|1| Take the wheel. Not the wheel. I'll make it easy. Shut it downto basic mode for you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Basic? Because I'm a girl?<|endoftext|>
|1| No.<|endoftext|>
|0| Everyone suit up. It's good salvage. I cansmell it.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's just trash.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, look. There's something tasty in the magno-field.<|endoftext|>
|0| Magno-grab ready. Engaging.<|endoftext|>
|0| Move yourself.<|endoftext|>
|0| What have I done?<|endoftext|>
|1| Er, okay.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|1| All the electrical impulses are jammed. I can't get the shieldsback up. She's completely vulnerable.<|endoftext|>
|0| I swear I just touched it.<|endoftext|>
|1| Magnetic hobble-field. We're flying right into it. Clara, stayby me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Please tell me there's a button you can press to fix this.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, yes. Big friendly button.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're lying.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yep.<|endoftext|>
|0| To stop me freaking out?<|endoftext|>
|1| Is it working?<|endoftext|>
|0| Not so much.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is it, some kind of escape pod?<|endoftext|>
|0| Come on.<|endoftext|>
|0| Crack it open.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's doing nothing.<|endoftext|>
|0| Use the thermo-charge and blast it.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, no, no, wait. It's like she's alive. She's, she'ssuffering. I can feel it. I can feel it.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, Gregor, he's right. Looks like there's a broken fuel line.<|endoftext|>
|0| All right. All right, put it back. No salvage today, boys. Openthe bay doors.<|endoftext|>
|0| Wait.<|endoftext|>
|0| Somebody's under that thing. The crew were still on board whenwe dragged her in.<|endoftext|>
|0| We did nothing. If anyone asks, that ship was already busted.You got that? And you, make sure you keep your oily mouth shut, right?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's rude to whisper. Hi. I'm the Doctor. And you are? Er, VanBaalen and Van Baalen. Van Baalen and Van Baalen. That's going to getconfusing later.<|endoftext|>
|0| We found you drifting.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, your ship was junked up pretty bad.<|endoftext|>
|1| What broke my ship was a magno-grab. Found this remote in yourpocket. Eh? What are the chances? Outlawed in most galaxies, thislittle beastie can disable whole vessels unless you have shieldoscillators, which I turned off so that Clara could fly, damn it.Clara. Where is she? Girl, about so high. Feisty. She's still on board.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, wait. Your pod is leaking fuel. If she's still in here,she's dead.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah, respirators.<|endoftext|>
|0| We can open the doors for a split second, reach in and grabher.<|endoftext|>
|1| Trust me, we can't. Now please, help me get her out.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm telling you, she fried<|endoftext|>
|0| Shut it, tin mouth. What sort of fee are we talking?<|endoftext|>
|1| If you help me get her out, you get the machine, all the scrap,eh?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's not worth the risk. Four feet of metal? Nah.<|endoftext|>
|1| What if I can guarantee you the best haul you've ever had?<|endoftext|>
|0| Bram, open the bay doors.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, no. Please, stop. Listen, listen. Right behind those doorsis the salvage of a lifetime.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor? Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|0| Red flashing light means something bad. Get out of here fast? Orpossibly, whatever you do, don't open this door.<|endoftext|>
|0| Bad decision.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hey, are we really going to risk it? Thatthing is spewing poison. We should blow it back into space.<|endoftext|>
|0| Get your gear.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hey, I don't take orders from my kid brother.<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't try and form sentences, all right? Stick to what you dobest.<|endoftext|>
|1| Tell me, since when does an android need a blast suit and arespirator?<|endoftext|>
|0| Flesh coating, same as us. He'd burn up.<|endoftext|>
|0| No fear, no hate, no pain.<|endoftext|>
|0| Salvage of a lifetime?<|endoftext|>
|1| I feel pretty confident I can deliver on that. Here we go.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't get it. I thought she was lying onher side.<|endoftext|>
|1| The Tardis is special. She has her own gravity. I'd explain ifI had some charts and a board pen.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's, it's, it's bigger<|endoftext|>
|1| On the inside. Do you know, I get that a lot.<|endoftext|>
|0| Whoa. Awesome.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well put. Whoa and awesome.<|endoftext|>
|1| Safe to breathe.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay, now, the last thing I remember, you were right there.Come on, Clara, talk to me.<|endoftext|>
|0| How big is this baby?<|endoftext|>
|1| Picture the biggest ship you've ever seen. Are you picturingit?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah.<|endoftext|>
|1| Good. Now forget it, because this ship is infinite.<|endoftext|>
|0| It could take you hours to find the girl.<|endoftext|>
|1| Days. Plus this whole place is toxic. She could be dead by thetime I reach her. So, here's the mission. We're going to find her inone hour.<|endoftext|>
|0| We?<|endoftext|>
|1| You're my guys for this.<|endoftext|>
|0| That wasn't the deal.<|endoftext|>
|1| 'Tis now.<|endoftext|>
|0| What makes you think we'll help?<|endoftext|>
|1| I just activated the Tardis self-destruct system. One houruntil this ship blows.<|endoftext|>
|1| Don't try to leave. The Tardis is in lockdown. I'll open thosedoors when Clara's by my side.<|endoftext|>
|0| You crazy lunatic!<|endoftext|>
|1| My ship, my rules.<|endoftext|>
|0| You'll kill us all. And the girl.<|endoftext|>
|1| She's going to die if you don't help me. Don't get into aspaceship with a madman. Didn't anyone ever teach you that? Okay, alittle gently persuasion. Say thirty minutes.<|endoftext|>
|0| She'll die even quicker now!<|endoftext|>
|1| We all perform better under pressure. Anybody want to go forfifteen minutes?<|endoftext|>
|0| Whoa!<|endoftext|>
|0| Whoa!<|endoftext|>
|1| It's your own time you're wasting. Salvage of a lifetime. Youmeant the ship. I meant Clara.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh!<|endoftext|>
|0| Report. What's on board this thing?<|endoftext|>
|0| Dynomorphic generators, conceptual geometer, beamsynthesiser, orthogonal engine filters.<|endoftext|>
|0| Guys, guys, look, I think we should split up. It's our bestchance of finding the girl. You know it is.<|endoftext|>
|1| Don't touch a thing. The Tardis will get huffy if you mess.<|endoftext|>
|0| Keep in radio contact, all right?<|endoftext|>
|0| Get back to the console. Strip it apart.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay.<|endoftext|>
|0| All right?<|endoftext|>
|0| Now that's just showing off.<|endoftext|>
|0| I made up the name Tardis from the initials Time AndRelative Dimension In Space.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Tardis is dimensionally transcendental.<|endoftext|>
|0| [OC]<|endoftext|>
|0| That's trans-dimensional engineering. A key Time Lorddiscovery.<|endoftext|>
|0| The assembled hordes of Genghis Khan couldn't getthrough that door. Believe me, they've tried.<|endoftext|>
|0| We are in space!<|endoftext|>
|0| It can move anywhere in time and space?<|endoftext|>
|0| Everything.<|endoftext|>
|0| What? Report.<|endoftext|>
|0| Everything, behind that door.<|endoftext|>
|0| Everything?<|endoftext|>
|0| Sensor detects everything you could possibly want.<|endoftext|>
|0| Everything.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't understand. Give me a price tag.<|endoftext|>
|0| Incalculable.<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|0| More valuable than the total sum of any currency. Livingmetal. Bespoke engineering. Whatever machine you require, this systemwill build it.<|endoftext|>
|1| No! No, no, stop! Please, don't. Don't touch it. Please. Shewon't let you touch it. I can feel a Tardis tantrum coming on.<|endoftext|>
|0| What the hell is this place?<|endoftext|>
|1| Architectural Reconfiguration System. It reconstructs particlesaccording to your needs.<|endoftext|>
|0| A machine that makes machines?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, basically. What are you doing? No, no, don't. Don't!<|endoftext|>
|1| If you walk out of here with that circuit, the Tardis will tryto stop you. Now listen to me. Look, the clock is ticking. We must findClara.<|endoftext|>
|0| What the? Where's the door gone?<|endoftext|>
|1| Ever seen a spaceship get ugly?<|endoftext|>
|0| This isn't happening.<|endoftext|>
|1| She won't relinquish it. Her basic genetic material.<|endoftext|>
|0| Torch it. I said, torch it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Can't you feel it, Gregor? The ship, the ship's in torment,like it's a living thing. You can't hurt it.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's the matter, Tardis? Scared to fight me?<|endoftext|>
|0| So that's who<|endoftext|>
|0| It's the same. It's just the same.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's diverting us, spinning a maze around us. We will neverreach Clara in time.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hey! Hey!<|endoftext|>
|0| It's just the same, again.<|endoftext|>
|1| No point in building walls. You'll just know how to smash themdown. It's found other ways of controlling you. Smart bunch, TimeLords. No dress sense, dreadful hats, but smart. If you want to get outof here, let that circuit go. It is creating a labyrinth.<|endoftext|>
|0| Bram? Bram, can you hear me?<|endoftext|>
|0| Bram, the ship is alive. Get out ofthere. Bram, don't touch anything.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're just the sweetest thing ever.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, thank you. Thank you. Thank you, thankyou, thank you.<|endoftext|>
|0| No! The door. Where's the door gone? No. You can't do this.<|endoftext|>
|0| Bram? You've got to get out of there fast.<|endoftext|>
|0| Channel's dead.<|endoftext|>
|0| We've got to help him. Gregor, do something. Do something!<|endoftext|>
|0| It's too late, he's gone. Let's just worry about the salvage.<|endoftext|>
|0| You care more about that circuit than you do about him.<|endoftext|>
|1| Your concern for your brother is really touching. The androidis more cut up about it that you. Now will you two stop bickering andlisten. There is something else down there.<|endoftext|>
|0| We've got to get out of here. Gregor, give it back. Give itback to her.<|endoftext|>
|0| What are you doing? You're always on the side of the machines.<|endoftext|>
|1| Fellas! Multiple lifeforms on board the Tardis with us. I amgetting a massive signal.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where are they?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, you're not going to like the answer. About two steps away.One step.<|endoftext|>
|1| Gregor, look out! Careful! Gregor, no! We have to staytogether. Come on, run. Tricky, run. I'm sorry.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, why are you doing this?<|endoftext|>
|0| Back where we started.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, it's an echo. The console room is the safest place on theship. It can replicate itself any number of times. It's trying toprotect us.<|endoftext|>
|0| Because I tried to give back the circuit?<|endoftext|>
|1| Team Tardis.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where did, where did that go?<|endoftext|>
|1| There's more than one echo room. Hey, look, look. The Tardishas got Clara safe. That was her. That was her there. Thank you, thankyou, thank you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why can't we see her?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's like a light switch. Two positions, flickering atsuper-infinite speeds. We're only together for a brief second. Shush.<|endoftext|>
|1| I can hear her.<|endoftext|>
|0| She's let it in. She's let it in!<|endoftext|>
|1| If I can just isolate her position, I can nudge thealternation, reach in and grab her.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who are you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Console room, echo imprint of theoriginal.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're coming with me. I need you to get me out of here.<|endoftext|>
|0| Scanning for female human. Scanning for female human.Unidentified human.<|endoftext|>
|1| It doesn't know Lancashire.<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|1| It doesn't know sass. Yes! It's found Clara. It's found her.She is right there.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's all right. Clara, I'm so, so sorry. Sorry. Please, pleaseforgive me, Clara.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ow! Okay, so we're not doing hugging. I get that now.<|endoftext|>
|0| What do you keep in here? Why have you got zombie creatures?Good guys do not have zombie creatures. Rule one basic storytelling.<|endoftext|>
|1| Not in front of the guests.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who are they?<|endoftext|>
|1| Friends. Well, people who aren't trying to kill us, so I don'tneed punching again.<|endoftext|>
|0| All right, all right. Look, a deal's a deal. You got the girlback. Now cancel the self-destruct.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah. Ah. You know, I've got to tell you, I won't be needing youin my quiz team.<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|1| There is no self-destruct. Hey? Hey? Hey? Had you going though,boys, didn't I? I just wiggled a few buttons. Yeah, the old wigglybutton trick. And the face. You've got to do the face. Save her or weall die. I though I rushed it a bit, but<|endoftext|>
|0| So you're telling us we're safe?<|endoftext|>
|1| Ish. Apart from the monsters and the Tardis reinventing thearchitecture every five minutes. Guys, don't worry. The countdown's afake. Look, just give me a second. I'll turn it off. I only made itlook as though the engine was actually exploding.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah. That's not good. Okay, don't panic. Or maybe panic.<|endoftext|>
|0| Something you want to share with the rest of us?<|endoftext|>
|1| It appears the engine is damaged. We're in trouble, Clara.Proper trouble. It needs fixing or we're toast.<|endoftext|>
|0| So now would be a good time to use that big friendly button,right?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes. Sorry, I should have had one built in.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where are we going?<|endoftext|>
|1| Detour.<|endoftext|>
|1| The centre of the Tardis.<|endoftext|>
|0| Shush. Something's in here.<|endoftext|>
|0| Those things, they've followed us.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, what are they? What aren't you telling me?<|endoftext|>
|1| Trust me. Some things you don't want to know.<|endoftext|>
|0| They're on the move again.<|endoftext|>
|1| Run. Move, move.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor? Doctor? Again.<|endoftext|>
|0| I know what I said. I was the one who said it.<|endoftext|>
|0| You said it was looking at you funny.<|endoftext|>
|0| Now you're creeping me out. Please tell me there is a buttonyou can press to fix this?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, thank god. Doctor, what's going on? Say something.<|endoftext|>
|1| Clara, stop. Don't touch it. There's a rupture in timesomewhere on board the ship. A small tear in the fabric of thecontinuum. It must have happened when the Tardis was pulled in by thesalvage vessel. The Tardis is leaking.<|endoftext|>
|0| Leaking what?<|endoftext|>
|1| The past. You and me. Everything we've done, everything we'vesaid. Recent history. It's not real. It's a memory.<|endoftext|>
|0| What about this?<|endoftext|>
|1| If you're giving me the option, I'd say this one's real.<|endoftext|>
|1| She's right on to us.<|endoftext|>
|0| She?<|endoftext|>
|1| Clara, don't ask me any more.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're like one of those guys who can't go out with a girlunless his mother approves.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's important to me you get along.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's that noise?<|endoftext|>
|1| We're right under the primary fuel cells.<|endoftext|>
|0| So? So, so what?<|endoftext|>
|1| So, so the fuel's spilled out, so the rods will be exposed.Means they'll cool<|endoftext|>
|0| And start to warp.<|endoftext|>
|1| And start to warp. Maybe even<|endoftext|>
|0| No, you don't say it. Don't you dare say it.<|endoftext|>
|1| Maybe even break apart.<|endoftext|>
|0| Run?<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm liking how you're thinking.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah.<|endoftext|>
|0| Cut it off. Just cut my arm off.<|endoftext|>
|0| No.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's the quickest way to release me. No fear, no hate, no pain.I can get a new one. Disposable parts. Just do it. It won't hurt me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Tricky, you just don't understand.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm an android. Cut me!<|endoftext|>
|0| You made it through.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's the matter with you? Why won't you cut me?<|endoftext|>
|1| Tell him.<|endoftext|>
|0| Tell me what?<|endoftext|>
|1| You can't, can you. You're a coward. You won't save him, butyou're scared to tell him why.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's he going on about?<|endoftext|>
|1| Robots don't need blast suits. They don't need respirators.They don't get frightened of monsters in the dark.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's he talking about?<|endoftext|>
|1| Two bionic eyes and a synthetic voice box. But you, my friend,are human. Flesh and blood.<|endoftext|>
|0| It was a joke.<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|0| It was just a stupid joke. We did it to relieve the boredom.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, it was very funny. They lied to you. Changed youridentity just to provide some in-flight entertainment.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm sorry. You're human, Tricky.<|endoftext|>
|1| Cut the metal. Cut the metal! Go!<|endoftext|>
|0| Where are we?<|endoftext|>
|1| Power source. Right, you lot, wait here. I'll check it's safe.We can only survive for a minute or two in there.<|endoftext|>
|0| Er, what happens if we stay longer?<|endoftext|>
|1| Our cells with liquefy and our skin will start to burn.<|endoftext|>
|0| I always feel so good after we've spoken.<|endoftext|>
|1| Marvellous. Keep this door shut.<|endoftext|>
|0| That will not be a problem.<|endoftext|>
|0| Lancashire. Sass.<|endoftext|>
|0| Intelligent sensor.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ever pointed that thing at yourself, Gregor? What would it see?What sort of person does this to another human? Made them believethey're made of metal. Who am I?<|endoftext|>
|0| My mouthy little kid brother.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why, why can't I remember?<|endoftext|>
|0| It was a salvage accident. There was a big explosion. You lostyour sight, voice and your memory.<|endoftext|>
|0| And you, you thought of a way you could have some fun with me?I just wanted a brother beside me!<|endoftext|>
|0| You were always the smart one, Tricky. He wanted you to takeover. He made you captain.<|endoftext|>
|0| He?<|endoftext|>
|0| Dad.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't remember him. You did this to me just to be captain ofa heap of junk.<|endoftext|>
|1| Stop! Tricky, listen to me. Ask yourself why he couldn't cutyou up. He has just one tiny scrap of decency left in him, and youhelped him find that, okay? Now you. Don't ever forget this.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay, move, move, move.<|endoftext|>
|1| The Eye of Harmony. Exploding star in the act of becoming ablack hole. Time Lord engineering. You rip the star from its orbit,suspend it in a permanent state of decay. This way, quickly.<|endoftext|>
|0| There's no way out. We're trapped.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're going to tell me right now. If we're going to die here,you're going to tell me what they are.<|endoftext|>
|1| I can't.<|endoftext|>
|0| Tell me. What's the use in secrets now?<|endoftext|>
|1| Secrets protect us. Secrets make us safe.<|endoftext|>
|0| We're not safe!<|endoftext|>
|0| Sensor detects animal DNA. Human core element. Calculatingdata. Calculating data.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, no, turn it off!<|endoftext|>
|0| Lancashire. Sass. Identifiable substance. Clara.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's me.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm so sorry.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's me. I burn in here.<|endoftext|>
|1| It isn't just the past leaking out through the time rift. It'sthe future. Listen, I brought you here to keep you safe, but ithappened again. You died again.<|endoftext|>
|0| What do you mean, again?<|endoftext|>
|1| Hang on. As long as we can interrupt the timeline, this can'thappen. Don't touch each other, otherwise the future will reassertitself.<|endoftext|>
|1| Gregor, Gregor, let go of the circuit.<|endoftext|>
|0| Just let it go.<|endoftext|>
|1| Gregor, Gregor.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay. Er, er<|endoftext|>
|0| Tricky!<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|1| No, don't touch him, or time will reassert itself.<|endoftext|>
|1| The engine room. The heart of the Tardis.<|endoftext|>
|0| We're outside.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, we're still in the Tardis.<|endoftext|>
|0| There's no way across.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, okay, you're right.<|endoftext|>
|0| So what do we do? Time for a plan. Do you have a plan?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, no. No plan. Sorry.<|endoftext|>
|0| If you don't have a plan, we're dead.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, we are. So just tell me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Tell you what?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, there's no point now. We're about to die. Just tell mewho you are.<|endoftext|>
|0| You know who I am.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, I don't. I look at you every single day and I don'tunderstand a thing about you. Why do I keep running into you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, you invited me. You said<|endoftext|>
|1| Before that. I met you in the Dalek Asylum. There was a girl ina shipwreck and she died saving my life, and she was you.<|endoftext|>
|0| She really wasn't.<|endoftext|>
|1| Victorian London. There was a governess who was really abarmaid, and we fought the Great Intelligence together. She died and itwas my fault, and she was you.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're scaring me.<|endoftext|>
|1| What are you, eh? Are you a trick, a trap?<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't know what you're talking about!<|endoftext|>
|1| You really don't, do you.<|endoftext|>
|0| I think I'm more scared of you right now than anything else onthat Tardis.<|endoftext|>
|1| You're just Clara, aren't you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, I don't know what the hell this is about, but the hug isreally nice.<|endoftext|>
|1| We're not going to die here. This isn't real! It's a snarl.<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|1| What does a wounded animal do? It tries to scare everyone away.We're close to the engine. The Tardis is snarling at us, trying tofrighten us off. We need to jump.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're insane.<|endoftext|>
|1| We'll cross a portal to the engine.<|endoftext|>
|0| How can you be so sure?<|endoftext|>
|1| I can't.<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay, well, that's watertight.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hey now, Clara, I have piloted this ship for over nine hundredyears. Trust me this one time, please. Okay. Okay. As well as all theother times. Ready? Geronimo.<|endoftext|>
|1| The heart of the Tardis. The engine, it's already exploded. Itmust have been the collision with the salvage ship.<|endoftext|>
|0| We're not dead.<|endoftext|>
|1| She wrapped her hands around the force. Froze it.<|endoftext|>
|0| So, so it's safe?<|endoftext|>
|1| Temporary fix. Eventually this whole place will erupt. There'sno way I can save her now. She's just always been there for me, andtaken care of me, and now it's my turn and I don't know what to do. Ithink it just<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, Clara. Oh.<|endoftext|>
|1| You are beautiful. Beautiful fragile human skin. Likeparchment. Thank you. The rift in time. All the memories leaking out. Ineed to find the moment we crashed. I need to find the music.<|endoftext|>
|1| The time rift. Recent past, possible future.<|endoftext|>
|0| What are you going to do?<|endoftext|>
|1| Rewrite today, I hope.<|endoftext|>
|1| I've thrown this through the rift before. I need to make surethis time. Going to take it in there myself. There might be a certainamount of yelling.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's going to hurt?<|endoftext|>
|1| Things that end your life often do that.<|endoftext|>
|0| Wait! All those things you said. How we've met before, how Idied.<|endoftext|>
|1| Clara, don't worry. You'll forget. Time mends us. It can mendanything.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't want to forget. Not all of it. The library. I saw it.You were mentioned in a book.<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm mentioned in a lot of books.<|endoftext|>
|0| You call yourself Doctor. Why do you do that? You have a name.I've seen it. In one corner of that tiny<|endoftext|>
|1| If I rewrite today, you won't remember. You won't go lookingfor my name.<|endoftext|>
|0| You'll still have secrets.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's better that way.<|endoftext|>
|1| Magnetic hobble-field. We're flying right into it. Clara, stayby me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Please tell me there's a button you can press to fix this.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, yes. Big friendly button.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're lying.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yep.<|endoftext|>
|0| To stop me freaking out?<|endoftext|>
|1| Is it working?<|endoftext|>
|0| Not so much.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, Doctor. I'm from your future. We haven't gotlong to reset time.<|endoftext|>
|1| Clara, no! No!<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah ha! Big friendly button.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't get it. It was on screen, then it was gone.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hey, robot, go get me some food. I'm starving.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oi, leave him alone.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's the matter with you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Maybe I've just got a little tiny scrap of decency.<|endoftext|>
|0| I feel exhausted. I feel<|endoftext|>
|1| We've had two days crammed into the space of one.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why would you say that?<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't know. I say stuff. Ignore me. Do you feel safe?<|endoftext|>
|0| Of course.<|endoftext|>
|1| Give me a number out of ten. Ten being whoo hoo, one beingargh.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're being weird.<|endoftext|>
|1| I need to know if you feel safe. I need to know you're notafraid.<|endoftext|>
|0| Of?<|endoftext|>
|1| The future. Running away with a spaceman in a box. Anythingcould happen to you.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's what I'm counting on. Push the button. <|endoftext|>
|0| If I have not returned in an hour, you must fetch the police.<|endoftext|>
|0| Edmund!<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't fret, Effie, my dear. All will be well, but we must getto the bottom of this dark and queer business no matter what the cost.<|endoftext|>
|0| Mrs Gillyflower!<|endoftext|>
|0| We have come about your husband, my dear. A tragedy.<|endoftext|>
|0| My husband?<|endoftext|>
|0| Your late husband.<|endoftext|>
|0| There must be some mistake. My husband is quite well.<|endoftext|>
|0| We're so very sorry for your loss.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hell fire. That's put me right off me mash. Another one.<|endoftext|>
|0| Another?<|endoftext|>
|0| He's not the first one I've had in here looking like that. TheCrimson Horror, that's what they're calling it.<|endoftext|>
|0| I have no interest in the deplorable excesses of the PennyDreadfuls.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hey, hey. Payment in advance, flower. Taking a big risk, you see,I am. They'll have my vitals for fiddle-strings if they knew I'd letyou come to look at one of their precious stiffs.<|endoftext|>
|0| This stiff is my brother. I've come up from London to bringhim home.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh aye?<|endoftext|>
|0| Thank you for agreeing to this meeting. I'm told you are theinvestigator to see if there are strange goings-on.<|endoftext|>
|0| I read of your brother's death. Another victim of the CrimsonHorror, I believe.<|endoftext|>
|0| So it is claimed. He was a newspaper man. He and a youngwoman were working undercover. Tell me, madam, do you know what anoptogram is?<|endoftext|>
|0| It is a silly superstition, sir. The belief that the eye canretain an image of the last thing it sees.<|endoftext|>
|0| Good grief.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, god.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, I'll be blowed. I think, madam, that we'd better makeplans to head north.<|endoftext|>
|0| According to my research, Sweetville'sproprietor holds recruitment drives for her little community. She isonly interested in the fittest and the most beautiful.<|endoftext|>
|0| You may rely on me, ma'am.<|endoftext|>
|0| I was, in fact, speaking to Jenny.<|endoftext|>
|0| Jenny. If this weak and fleshy boy is to represent us, Istrongly recommend the issuing of scissor grenades, limbo vapour andtriple blast brain splitters.<|endoftext|>
|0| What for?<|endoftext|>
|0| Just generally. Remember, we are going to the north.<|endoftext|>
|0| Bradford, that Babylon of the moderns with its crystallight and its glitter, all aswarm with the wretched ruins of humanity.Men and women crushed by the devil's juggernaut.<|endoftext|>
|0| And moral turpitude can destroy the most delicate oflives. Believe me, I know. I know.<|endoftext|>
|0| Me own daughter, blinded in a drunken rage by my latehusband. Her once beautiful eyes, pale and white as mistletoe berries.<|endoftext|>
|0| And what, my friends, is your story? Will you be foundwanting when the End of Days is come, when judgement rains down upon usall? Or will you be preserved against the coming apocalypse? Do notdespair. I offer a way out. There is a different path. Sweetville!<|endoftext|>
|0| Join us. Join us in this shining city on the hill. (sings)Bring me my bow of burning gold. Bring me my arrows of desire.<|endoftext|>
|0| You wish to join us, my dear?<|endoftext|>
|0| If it's all the same with you, ma'am.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh yes, dear. You'll do very nicely.<|endoftext|>
|0| If our stratagem succeeds, Jenny willinfiltrate deep into the black heart of this curious place.<|endoftext|>
|0| And how will she locate the Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|0| Business as usual.<|endoftext|>
|0| Did you think I'd forgotten you, dear monster, hmm?<|endoftext|>
|0| I have travelled from London expressly to see Madame Vastra.If you'd be so kind as to announce me, my good man.<|endoftext|>
|0| Whom shall I say is calling?<|endoftext|>
|0| It asked for permission to enter and then it fell over. What arewe to make of it?<|endoftext|>
|0| I imagine Mister Thursday wants to know what progress we aremaking. The question is, how did the Doctor's image come to bepreserved on a dead man's eye? It's a scientific impossibility. Iwonder how Jenny is getting on.<|endoftext|>
|0| If she hasn't make contact by nightfall, I suggest a massivefrontal assault on the factory, madam. Casualties can be kept toperhaps as little as eighty percent.<|endoftext|>
|0| I think there may be subtler ways of proceeding, Strax.<|endoftext|>
|0| Suit yourself.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm dead nervous, aren't you? They have to be sure, you see.Only the best for Sweetville. I hope me teeth don't let me down. I'mAbigail.<|endoftext|>
|0| Pleased to meet you.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're not local, are you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Nah. Up from London.<|endoftext|>
|0| Different here, I bet.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah. Like a bleeding horse market. Do you know anyone who'scome to live here? In Sweetville, I mean.<|endoftext|>
|0| I had a pal who come here three month back. She wrote to tellme how perfect it all were. Funny, though. I've not heard a peep fromher since.<|endoftext|>
|0| Next, please!<|endoftext|>
|0| Hang on, we're moving.<|endoftext|>
|0| What're you doing?<|endoftext|>
|0| Do me a favour. Cause a distraction.<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|0| Swoon. Have a funny turn. Fit of the vapours.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are you crackers?<|endoftext|>
|0| Go on. There's a guinea in it for you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Done.<|endoftext|>
|0| Them new manufacturers can do horriblethings to a person. Horrible. I've pickled things in here that'd fairturn your hair snowy as top of Buckden Pike.<|endoftext|>
|0| You know what I'm looking for.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, aye. All them bits found in t'canal. The Crimson Horror.<|endoftext|>
|0| It hardly seems possible.<|endoftext|>
|0| Eh?<|endoftext|>
|0| I think, I think I've seen these symptoms before.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh aye?<|endoftext|>
|0| A long time ago.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh aye? How long?<|endoftext|>
|0| About sixty five million years.<|endoftext|>
|0| I trust you had a pleasant day, Mama?<|endoftext|>
|0| Tolerable.<|endoftext|>
|0| Will Mister Sweet ever join us for dinner, Mama?<|endoftext|>
|0| Mister Sweet is rather tired tonight, I fear.<|endoftext|>
|0| Dear me. How clumsy I'm getting.<|endoftext|>
|0| To keep the Devil at bay.<|endoftext|>
|0| All right, mate. You just stay calm now. (thump and rattle ofchains) I could open this door. Would you like that? (thump) Thoughtyou might. But you and me has got to come to an arrangement. Savvy?(thump) Now, you stand well back, do you hear me? I don't mean no harmto you, but you try anything funny and I'll leave you here to rot. Isthat understood? (thump, thump) Right.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|0| What happened to you? Can't you speak?<|endoftext|>
|0| Right. Right, we're getting out of here.<|endoftext|>
|0| Come on.<|endoftext|>
|0| Come on!<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh my gawd.<|endoftext|>
|0| You are all I have, monster, but all will bewell. Imperfect as we are, there will be room for us in the newJerusalem.<|endoftext|>
|0| No. No! Where are you, monster? Where are you?<|endoftext|>
|0| What is it? You want to go in there?<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah! Missed me?<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|1| Jenny. Jenny, Jenny, Jenny, Jenny. Just when you think yourfavourite lock-picking Victorian chambermaid will never turn up. Jenny.<|endoftext|>
|1| You have no idea how good that feels. Right. Mrs Gillyflower.We've got to stop her. And then there's Clara. Poor Clara. Where'sClara?<|endoftext|>
|0| Clara? Doctor, wait.<|endoftext|>
|1| Can't. Clara. Got to find.<|endoftext|>
|0| What happened to you? How long have you been like that?<|endoftext|>
|1| Days, weeks, don't know. Long story. I'll keep it short.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay, so. Not London 1893. Yorkshire 1893. Near enough.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're making a habit of this, getting us lost.<|endoftext|>
|1| Sorry. It's much better than it used to be. Ooo, I once spent ahell of a long time trying to get a gobby Australian to HeathrowAirport.<|endoftext|>
|0| What for?<|endoftext|>
|1| Search me. Anyway<|endoftext|>
|1| Brave heart, Clara.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's another one. Don't you see? Another victim. Why won't anyone of you listen?<|endoftext|>
|1| We'll listen.<|endoftext|>
|0| Mrs Winifred Gillyflower. An astonishing woman. Prize winningchemist and mechanical engineer. So why<|endoftext|>
|1| Why has she decided to open up a match factory in her old hometown.<|endoftext|>
|0| And no one who ever goes to live there ever seems to come out.<|endoftext|>
|0| Same as the rest. All dead from causes unknown and their fleshglowing.<|endoftext|>
|0| Like something manky in a coal cellar. They keep turning up int'canal. The Crimson Horror.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ooo, good name. Hey, that's good, isn't it? The Crimson Horror.I wonder what it is. Do you know the old Romany superstition, Clara?That the eye of a dead person retains an image of the last thing itsees. Nonsense, of course, unless the chemical composition of the bodyhas been massively corrupted.<|endoftext|>
|1| Wow, this is nasty. An organic poison. A sort of venom. And youthink it's connected to Sweetville?<|endoftext|>
|0| I do.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well then, we need a plan.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor and Mrs Smith. Oh yes, you'll do very nicely.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, grand. Smashing. Eh, the missis and I couldn't be morechuffed, could we, love?<|endoftext|>
|0| Sweetville will provide you with everything you need. Youwon't have to worry about a thing ever again.<|endoftext|>
|0| The name, Sweetville.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes?<|endoftext|>
|0| Why not name it after yourself. After al, it's your creation.<|endoftext|>
|1| Gillyflowertown. Gillyflowerland. You could have rollercoasters.<|endoftext|>
|0| It is named in tribute to my partner.<|endoftext|>
|1| Your late partner?<|endoftext|>
|0| No, my silent partner. Mister Sweet likes to keep himselfto himself. Shall we move on?<|endoftext|>
|1| Who lives here?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, names don't matter here. All you need to know is weonly recruit the brightest and the best.<|endoftext|>
|0| Like pretty maids all in a row. The process improves withevery attempt. Mister Sweet is such a clever old thing. Oh, into thecanal with the rejects, Ada.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ma.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sometimes the preservation process goes wrong. Only Mister Sweetknows why, and only Mama is allowed to talk to Mister Sweet. But ifyou're very good, you can stay here. You'll be my secret. My specialmonster. Shush.<|endoftext|>
|1| Poor Edmund must have come looking for usand then fallen into a vat of the pure venom. Or was pushed. Didn'tstand a chance.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is that stuff, though?<|endoftext|>
|1| Deadly poison. And Mrs Gillyflower's been dipping her pilgrimsin a dilute form to protect them. Preserve them. Process didn't work onme. Maybe because I'm not human. I ended up on the reject pile.<|endoftext|>
|0| Preserve them against what?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, according to her, the coming apocalypse.<|endoftext|>
|0| When the End of Days is come and judgement rains down upon usall.<|endoftext|>
|1| What?<|endoftext|>
|0| Nothing.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, no, no. What?<|endoftext|>
|0| Something Mrs Gillyflower said. One of her sermons. Madame willcome looking for me. We'd best get on.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes, Clara. Got to find Clara.<|endoftext|>
|0| But, Doctor. Clara's dead. Isn't she?<|endoftext|>
|1| It's complicated.<|endoftext|>
|0| Horse, you have failed in your mission. We are lost, with nosign of Sweetville. Do you have any final words before your summaryexecution? The usual story. Fourth one this week, and I'm not evenhungry.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sweetville, sir?<|endoftext|>
|0| Do you know it?<|endoftext|>
|0| Turn around when possible. Then, at the end of the road, turnright.<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|0| Bear left for a quarter of a mile and you will have reachedyour destination.<|endoftext|>
|0| Thank you. What is your name?<|endoftext|>
|0| Thomas, sir. Thomas Thomas.<|endoftext|>
|0| I think you will do well, Thomas Thomas.<|endoftext|>
|0| Are we talking about the same person? Aboutthat Clara? Doctor!<|endoftext|>
|1| I couldn't see much from where I was, but I think she survivedthe process. She must be here somewhere.<|endoftext|>
|0| But Clara died. The Ice Lady? Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, it's er, it's complicated.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is the meaning of this?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, Mama, I have been foolish. I have formed a sentimentalattachment.<|endoftext|>
|0| An attachment? To whom?<|endoftext|>
|0| A young man. Unlike the others, he survived rejection. He must bestrong. Worthy of salvation.<|endoftext|>
|0| Wrecker. Berserker! You have loosed a reject onto theoutside world.<|endoftext|>
|0| I have disappointed you.<|endoftext|>
|0| My plans must be accelerated. Nothing must interfere withthe Great Work.<|endoftext|>
|0| But please say there is still room for me in your new Eden, Mama.Promise me that.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'll set my pilgrims onto him.<|endoftext|>
|0| No!<|endoftext|>
|0| Kindly do not claw and slobber at my crinoline. You know Icannot bear to look at sick people.<|endoftext|>
|0| Promise me you will not abandon me, Mama. Promise me that.<|endoftext|>
|0| Do you not yet understand? There can be no place forpeople such as you. That only perfection is good enough for myself andMister Sweet. The bright day is done, child, and you are for the dark.<|endoftext|>
|0| Can she be revived, like you were?<|endoftext|>
|1| I hope so.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, great. Great. Attack of the supermodels. Time for a plan.<|endoftext|>
|0| Nah, Doctor. This one's on me.<|endoftext|>
|1| That is a plan.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay, time for a new plan. Run!<|endoftext|>
|0| Sontar ha!<|endoftext|>
|0| Let's go.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, ma'am. We're not escaping. We've got to help the Doctor withClara.<|endoftext|>
|1| Long story.<|endoftext|>
|0| What now, madam? We could lay mimetic cluster mines.<|endoftext|>
|0| Strax.<|endoftext|>
|0| Or dig trenches and fill them with acid.<|endoftext|>
|0| Strax! You're overexcited. Have you been eating Miss Jenny'ssherbet fancies again?<|endoftext|>
|0| No.<|endoftext|>
|0| Go outside and wait for me until I call for you.<|endoftext|>
|0| But madam, I<|endoftext|>
|0| Go!<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm going to go play with my grenades.<|endoftext|>
|1| Okay, I think she's about done.<|endoftext|>
|1| I know who you think she is, but she isn't. She can't be.<|endoftext|>
|0| I was right, then. You and Clara have unfinished business.<|endoftext|>
|1| There, there. Hello, stranger.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah ha.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hi. What's going on?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, haven't you heard, love? There's trouble at mill. She's alizard.<|endoftext|>
|0| My people once ruled this world, as wellyou know, but we did not rule it alone. Just as humanity fights a dailybattle against nature, so did we. And our greatest plague, the mostvirulent enemy, was the repulsive red leech.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ooo, the Repulsive Red Leech. Nah. On balance I think I preferthe Crimson Horror. What was it, exactly?<|endoftext|>
|0| A tiny parasite. It infected our drinking water. And once inour systems, it secreted a fatal poison.<|endoftext|>
|1| If it's been hanging around, lurking in the shadows, maybe it'sevolved. Or maybe it's had help.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, I've been thinking. The chimney<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Way past that now. Yucky redparasite from the time of the dinosaurs pitches up in VictorianYorkshire. Didn't see that one coming.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah, but the chimney<|endoftext|>
|1| But what's the connection to Mrs Gillyflower? Judgement willrain down on us all. An empty mill.<|endoftext|>
|0| A chimney that doesn't blow smoke.<|endoftext|>
|1| Clever clogs.<|endoftext|>
|0| Missed me?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, lots.<|endoftext|>
|1| She's going to poison the air.<|endoftext|>
|0| How?<|endoftext|>
|0| With that, I should think.<|endoftext|>
|1| And there's the poison. All right, gang, I've got a plan.<|endoftext|>
|1| Shush. Okay.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who is that? Who is there?<|endoftext|>
|0| You. It's you. My monster. You've come back. But you're<|endoftext|>
|1| Warm. And alive, thanks to you, Ada. You saved me from yourmother's human rubbish tip. Now then, what's wrong?<|endoftext|>
|0| She does not want me, monster. I am not to be chosen. Perhaps itwas my own sin, the blackness in my heart that my father saw in me.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ada, no. That's nonsense. Stupid, backward nonsense, and youknow it. You know it.<|endoftext|>
|0| What is it?<|endoftext|>
|0| Who is that?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm, I'm a friend. A friend of his.<|endoftext|>
|0| Then you are fortunate indeed. It isn't good to be alone.<|endoftext|>
|1| Now, Ada, I need you to tell me something. Who is Mister Sweet?Ada?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, dear monster<|endoftext|>
|1| Please, tell me.<|endoftext|>
|0| I cannot. Even now, I cannot. I cannot betray Mama.<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, come with us, then. There's something you need to know.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, you do seem to keep turning up like a bad penny, youngman.<|endoftext|>
|1| Force of habit.<|endoftext|>
|0| Can I offer you something? Tea? Seed cake? Oh, a glass ofAmontillado?<|endoftext|>
|1| No, thanks. We've had a skinful already, as you might say.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ha, ha. Very funny.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes. I'm the Doctor, you're nuts and I'm going to stop you.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm afraid Mister Sweet and I cannot allow that.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah, yes. Would it be impolite to ask why you and Mister Sweetare petrifying your workforce with diluted prehistoric leech venom?<|endoftext|>
|0| So when do we get to meet him, this silent partner of yours?Why's he so shy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Mister Sweet is always with us.<|endoftext|>
|1| You seem to have a very close relationship, you and your pal.<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh yes, Doctor. Exceedingly close. Symbiotic, you mightsay.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, what is it?<|endoftext|>
|0| A survivor. He has grown fat on the filth humanity haspumped into the rivers. That's where I found him.<|endoftext|>
|1| Very enterprising.<|endoftext|>
|0| His needs are simple, and in return he gives me hisnectar.<|endoftext|>
|1| Mrs Gillyflower, you have no idea what you are dealing with. Inthe wrong hands, that venom could wipe out all life on this planet.<|endoftext|>
|0| Do you know what these are? Ha, ha! The wrong hands.<|endoftext|>
|1| Planning a little fireworks party, are we?<|endoftext|>
|0| You have forced me to advance the Great Work somewhat,Doctor, but my colossal scheme remains as it was. My rocket willexplode high in the atmosphere, raining down Mister Sweet's beneficenceonto all humanity.<|endoftext|>
|0| And wiping us all out. You can't!<|endoftext|>
|0| My new Adam and Eves will sleep for but a few monthsbefore stepping out into a golden dawn. Is it not beautiful, Doctor?<|endoftext|>
|1| Now, tell us about Ada, Mrs Gillyflower.<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|1| Your daughter. You do remember your daughter? Tell us aboutyour daughter.<|endoftext|>
|0| How can you speak of such trivia when my hour is at hand?The child is of no consequence.<|endoftext|>
|1| Is that why you experimented on her?<|endoftext|>
|0| Experimented?<|endoftext|>
|1| The signs are all there. The pattern of scarring. You used heras a guinea pig, didn't you.<|endoftext|>
|0| God.<|endoftext|>
|0| Sometimes sacrifices must be made.<|endoftext|>
|1| Sacrifices?<|endoftext|>
|0| It was necessary. I had to find out how much of the venomwould produce an anti-toxin to immunise myself. Don't you see? It wasnecessary!<|endoftext|>
|0| Mama? Is it, is it true?<|endoftext|>
|0| Ada.<|endoftext|>
|0| It is. It's true. True.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ada, listen to me.<|endoftext|>
|0| You hag! You perfidious hag! You virago! You harpy! All theseyears I have helped you, served you, looked after you. Do they countfor nothing, nothing at all?<|endoftext|>
|0| No, stop. Stop.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hang on, I've got a sonic screwdriver.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah? I've got a chair!<|endoftext|>
|0| No!<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah. That worked. I'm afraid your rocket isn't going anywhere,Mrs G.<|endoftext|>
|0| Please, come to me, Ada. Oh, my child. You have alwaysbeen so very useful.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, Mrs Gillyflower.<|endoftext|>
|0| Please, Mama. No more. No more.<|endoftext|>
|0| And now, if you'll please forgive us, we must be going. Itis long past Ada's bedtime.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, no, Clara. If we follow straight after her, she'll shootAda on the spot.<|endoftext|>
|0| She wouldn't.<|endoftext|>
|1| She would. Chairs are useful.<|endoftext|>
|0| Come along, Ada. Don't dawdle.<|endoftext|>
|0| Please, Mama, stop.<|endoftext|>
|0| Has the venom been loaded?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, ma'am.<|endoftext|>
|0| Then heaven awaits you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Stop!<|endoftext|>
|1| Just let her go, Mrs Gillyflower. Let Ada go.<|endoftext|>
|0| Secondary firing mechanism, Doctor. Mister Sweet and I aretoo smart for you, after all.<|endoftext|>
|1| Just let your daughter go, Mrs Gillyflower.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ada!<|endoftext|>
|0| Shoot if you wish, Mama. It is of no matter, for you killed me along time ago.<|endoftext|>
|0| (sings) I'll labour night and day to be a pilgrim.<|endoftext|>
|0| Now, Mister Sweet, now the whole world will taste yourlethal kiss!<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't think so, Mrs Gillyflower.<|endoftext|>
|0| Very well, then. If I can't take the world with me, youwill have to do. Die, you freaks. Die! Die!<|endoftext|>
|0| Put down your weapon, human female.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ouch.<|endoftext|>
|0| No. No. Mister Sweet, where are you going? You can't leaveme now, Mister Sweet.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's it doing?<|endoftext|>
|1| It knows she's dying. She's no longer of any use to it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Mister Sweet. Ada?<|endoftext|>
|0| Ada. Are you there?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm here, Mama.<|endoftext|>
|0| Forgive me, my child. Forgive me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Never.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's my girl.<|endoftext|>
|0| What will you do with that thing?<|endoftext|>
|1| Take it back to the Jurassic era, maybe. Out of harm's way.<|endoftext|>
|1| On the other hand<|endoftext|>
|1| Right. Right, London. We were heading forLondon, weren't we?<|endoftext|>
|0| Was there any particular reason?<|endoftext|>
|1| No. No. Just thought you might like it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah. Maybe had enough of Victorian values for a bit.<|endoftext|>
|1| You're the boss.<|endoftext|>
|0| Am I?<|endoftext|>
|1| No. No. Get in.<|endoftext|>
|1| Now, Ada, I'd love to stay and help clear up the mess, but<|endoftext|>
|0| I know, dear monster. You have things to do.<|endoftext|>
|1| And what about you?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, there are many things a bright young lady can do to occupy hertime. It's time I stepped out of the darkness and into the light.<|endoftext|>
|1| Good luck, Ada. You know, I think you will be just<|endoftext|>
|1| Splendid. Well, thanks a million, you three, as ever. Have somePontefract cakes on me. I love Pontefract cakes. See you around, eh, Ishouldn't wonder.<|endoftext|>
|0| But Doctor. That girl, Clara. You haven't explained.<|endoftext|>
|1| No, I haven't.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ah, look at the muck in here. Right!<|endoftext|>
|0| Another one for the vault.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ah, there you are. I called to see whether there had been anyprogress.<|endoftext|>
|0| The boss. Yep, that's me.<|endoftext|>
|0| I am the boss.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's you, isn't it. It's from the seventies, but it's definitelyyou.<|endoftext|>
|0| Of course it's not.<|endoftext|>
|0| And that's you too, from 1983. I found it at school.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, that's just someone who looks like me.<|endoftext|>
|0| And that's someone that looks like your boyfriend.<|endoftext|>
|0| Is he an alien?<|endoftext|>
|0| Why would he be an alien?<|endoftext|>
|0| The chin.<|endoftext|>
|0| And the time travel?<|endoftext|>
|0| That's not right.<|endoftext|>
|0| You were in Victorian London.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, I was in Victorian Yorkshire.<|endoftext|>
|0| How come you didn't tell us?<|endoftext|>
|0| Time travel, that's so cool.<|endoftext|>
|0| Can we have a go?<|endoftext|>
|0| Can you have a what?<|endoftext|>
|0| We want a shot at the time machine.<|endoftext|>
|0| No, no, no, no. Listen<|endoftext|>
|0| Okay. Or, we'll have to tell Dad that our nanny's a timetraveller. <|endoftext|>
|1| Well, here we are. Hedgewick's World. The biggest and bestamusement park there will ever be, and we've got a golden ticket. Eh?Eh? Fun.<|endoftext|>
|0| Fun?<|endoftext|>
|0| Your stupid box can't even get us to the right place. This islike a moon base or something.<|endoftext|>
|1| It's not the moon.<|endoftext|>
|0| Actually, I think it does look like the moon, only dirtier.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hey. Guys. It's not the moon, okay? It's a Spacey Zoomer ride,or it was.<|endoftext|>
|0| Psst. Excuse I. I don't suppose you happen to be my lift offplanet? Dave's Discount Interstellar Removals?<|endoftext|>
|0| Afraid not.<|endoftext|>
|0| They were meant to be here six months ago. Well, that's Davefor you, see? Unreliable.<|endoftext|>
|0| Stay where you are!<|endoftext|>
|0| Oops.<|endoftext|>
|0| Throw down your weapons and identify yourselves.<|endoftext|>
|1| No. No weapons. Golden ticket. Spacey Zoomer. Free ice cream?<|endoftext|>
|0| Who are you? This planet is closed, by Imperial order.<|endoftext|>
|1| How's this?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh. Welcome, Proconsul. I wish they'd told us you were coming.Any news of the Emperor?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh, the Emperor. No, no. None that you'd er<|endoftext|>
|0| We pray for his return. If there is anything you need, myplatoon is at your service.<|endoftext|>
|1| Right. Righty-o. Well, carry on, Captain.<|endoftext|>
|0| Platoon, let's move out! On the double. Two, three, four. Two,three, four. Two, three, four.<|endoftext|>
|0| Have they gone?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Uniforms give me the heebie-jeebies. Come on. They can't stopme being here, but they don't like it.<|endoftext|>
|1| Ha, ha! You see? I told you it was amazing. Well, it used tobe.<|endoftext|>
|0| It closed down. Wish I'd known that before I landed here. Butlet me show you my collection. Come along. Follow me. This way. Thisway in, come on.<|endoftext|>
|0| Welcome to my show. Webley's World of Wonders. Miracles,marvels and more await you. I am Impresario Webley. You see before youwaxwork representations of the famous and the infamous. Anybody hereplay chess?<|endoftext|>
|0| Perhaps you, young man?<|endoftext|>
|0| Actually, I'm in my school chess club.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ah. Follow me.<|endoftext|>
|0| Now, let demonstrate to you all the wonderof the age, the miracle of modernity.<|endoftext|>
|0| We defeated them all a thousand years ago, but now he's back,to destroy you. Behold, the enemy!<|endoftext|>
|1| Cyberman! Get down!<|endoftext|>
|0| No need to panic, my young friends. We all know there are nomore living Cybermen. What you are seeing is a miracle. The six hundredand ninety ninth wonder of the universe, as displayed before theImperial court, and only here to destroy you at chess.<|endoftext|>
|0| Careful now. An empty shell, and yet it moves. How?<|endoftext|>
|0| Magic.<|endoftext|>
|0| That might well be, young lady, but a single penny wins youfive Imperial shillings<|endoftext|>
|0| If you can beat this empty shell at chess.<|endoftext|>
|0| I haven't got a penny, but I've got a sandwich.<|endoftext|>
|0| All right, take a seat. It is free of all devices, and yet ithas never been beaten. Would you like to make the first move, youngman?<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh no, Artie. No, don't do that, it<|endoftext|>
|1| That's a fool's mate.<|endoftext|>
|0| If you can tell me how it works, I'll give you a silver penny.<|endoftext|>
|0| I think you do it with mirrors?<|endoftext|>
|1| Hmm. Mirrors. Clever girl. Well, let's see, hey? Low tech. It'sa puppet. Monofilament strings, which means the brains are in<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hello.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm the brains.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hello.<|endoftext|>
|0| Give us a hand.<|endoftext|>
|0| They call me Porridge. Oh, it's good to be out of that box.<|endoftext|>
|0| For you, Miss, an Imperial penny.<|endoftext|>
|0| I have not one but three Cybermen in mycollection.<|endoftext|>
|0| Is that the King?<|endoftext|>
|0| Emperor. Ludens Nimrod Kendrick, etc, etc, the forty first.Defender of Humanity, Imperator of known space.<|endoftext|>
|0| He looks a bit full of himself.<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't say things like that about the Imperial family. You canend up on the run for the rest of your life.<|endoftext|>
|0| They don't sound very nice.<|endoftext|>
|0| Go on. If the kids want to ride the Spacey Zoomer, then I canoperate the gravity console.<|endoftext|>
|0| Angie!<|endoftext|>
|0| Wow!<|endoftext|>
|0| Smile! Say, Spacey Zoomer.<|endoftext|>
|0| Look at us, Doctor. We're flying!<|endoftext|>
|1| Having a good time?<|endoftext|>
|0| I think that was the most fun I've had in my whole life.<|endoftext|>
|0| It was (pause) okay.<|endoftext|>
|0| Clara, I think outer space is actually very interesting.<|endoftext|>
|0| Right. Wonderful day out, Doctor, but time to get the kids home.<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah. Er, no. Not actually ready to leave.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why not?<|endoftext|>
|1| I don't know. Reasons.<|endoftext|>
|0| What reasons?<|endoftext|>
|1| Insects. Funny insects. I should a them to my funny insectcollection.<|endoftext|>
|0| You collect funny insects?<|endoftext|>
|1| Yeah, I'm starting to, right now.<|endoftext|>
|0| How long do we have to stay here?<|endoftext|>
|1| Not long. Have a nap. I'll wake you when we're ready to leave.<|endoftext|>
|0| Comfy?<|endoftext|>
|0| Sleep well.<|endoftext|>
|0| Good night.<|endoftext|>
|1| Don't wander off. Now, I'm not just saying don't wander off, Imean it. Otherwise you'll wander off and the next thing you know,somebody's going to have to start rescuing somebody.<|endoftext|>
|0| From what?<|endoftext|>
|1| Nothing. Nobody needs rescuing from anything. Don't wander off.Sweet dreams.<|endoftext|>
|0| Total takings for the day, one sandwich. Better than nosandwich, of course. Not as good as two sandwiches, or even a chicken.<|endoftext|>
|0| That's a bit odd. That's not funny. Give me my hands back.<|endoftext|>
|0| Upgrade in progress.<|endoftext|>
|0| I hate the future. It's stupid. There's not even phone service.I'm out of here.<|endoftext|>
|0| The Doctor said not to wander off.<|endoftext|>
|0| He said that, and then he wandered off.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't think Clara would like that.<|endoftext|>
|0| She's not our mum.<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't leave me here.<|endoftext|>
|0| Was this really the biggest amusement park in the universe?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah. Hedgewick bought the planet cheap. It'd been trashed inthe Cyberwars.<|endoftext|>
|0| Who were we fighting?<|endoftext|>
|0| Cybermen. Technologically upgraded warriors. We couldn't win.Sometimes we fought to a draw, but then they'd upgrade themselves, fixtheir weaknesses and destroy us. It's hard to fight an enemy that usesyour armies as spare parts.<|endoftext|>
|0| You beat them, though. Beat them or you wouldn't be here. How?<|endoftext|>
|0| Look up there. That corner of sky? What do you see?<|endoftext|>
|0| Nothing. It's just black. No stars, no nothing.<|endoftext|>
|0| It use to be the Tiberion Spiral Galaxy. A million starsystems, a hundred million worlds, a billion trillion people. It's notthere any more. No more Tiberion Galaxy. No more Cybermen. It waseffective.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's horrible.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah. I feel like a monster sometimes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Why?<|endoftext|>
|0| Because instead of mourning a billion trillion dead people, Ijust feel sorry for the poor blighter who had to press the button andblow it all up.<|endoftext|>
|1| Clara, did you tell Angie she could go to the barracks?<|endoftext|>
|0| You know I didn't. She hasn't.<|endoftext|>
|1| She's just gone in there.<|endoftext|>
|0| Come on.<|endoftext|>
|0| I can't fix this.<|endoftext|>
|0| It can't be broken. It's a solid state subether ansible classcommunicator. Just run the diagnostics.<|endoftext|>
|0| There's nothing left to diagnose. It's not broken, it's empty.All the components have gone.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, you must have replacement parts.<|endoftext|>
|0| Not enough to build a new one.<|endoftext|>
|0| Captain, the weather controller is malfunctioning again.There's storms, heat waves, snow.<|endoftext|>
|0| Hello, I'm bored.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where's your big sister?<|endoftext|>
|0| Clara? She's not my sister. She's stupid. She's talking toPorridge.<|endoftext|>
|0| She talks to her porridge?<|endoftext|>
|0| Porridge. That little bloke?<|endoftext|>
|0| We need to have a chat.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm not scared, if you're wondering. I just think I ought toturn the lights back on.<|endoftext|>
|0| So, tell me about the little bloke.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, you must have seen him.<|endoftext|>
|0| Angie! Angie!<|endoftext|>
|0| She always has to turn up and spoil everything. I wasn't doinganything. Why can't you just leave me alone?<|endoftext|>
|0| Cyberman!<|endoftext|>
|0| Angie!<|endoftext|>
|0| Attack formation.<|endoftext|>
|0| No! Attack formation, quickly.<|endoftext|>
|0| Upgrade in progress.<|endoftext|>
|0| Angie!<|endoftext|>
|0| Angie!<|endoftext|>
|1| Clara. Clara!<|endoftext|>
|0| That was a Cyberman. But they're extinct.<|endoftext|>
|1| Listen to me. I will get her back. Captain, a word please. Now,correct me if I'm wrong, but I take it your platoon doesn't do muchfighting.<|endoftext|>
|0| What do you expect?<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|0| We're a punishment platoon. It's why they sent us out here, sowe can't get into trouble.<|endoftext|>
|1| Right, right, well, okay. As Imperial Consul, I'm putting Clarain charge.<|endoftext|>
|1| Clara, stay alive until I get back, and don't let anyone blowup this planet.<|endoftext|>
|0| Is that something they're likely to do?<|endoftext|>
|1| Get to somewhere defensible.<|endoftext|>
|0| Where are you going?<|endoftext|>
|1| I'm getting Angie, finding Artie and looking for funny insects.Stay alive. And you lot, no blowing up this planet!<|endoftext|>
|0| Put me down! I hate you!<|endoftext|>
|0| Artie? Artie, what's happening?<|endoftext|>
|0| Please stand by. You will be upgraded.<|endoftext|>
|0| Cyberiad class weaponry. I've taken itout of storage.<|endoftext|>
|0| Good. We need to find somewhere defensible. Where?<|endoftext|>
|0| The beach, the Giant's Cauldron, Natty Longshoe's ComicalCastle.<|endoftext|>
|0| Real castle? Drawbridge? Moat?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes, but comical.<|endoftext|>
|0| We'll go there.<|endoftext|>
|0| Ma'am, my platoon can deal with one Cyberman, and there areprotocols if we cannot immediately find and destroy it.<|endoftext|>
|0| Blowing up the planet protocols?<|endoftext|>
|0| Respectfully, ma'am.<|endoftext|>
|0| Somewhere defensible. No blowing up the planet.<|endoftext|>
|0| She's your commanding officer now, isn't she, Captain?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes. Sir.<|endoftext|>
|0| You really saw a Cyberman?<|endoftext|>
|0| We really did.<|endoftext|>
|0| Have you reported it to the Imperium?<|endoftext|>
|0| No communicators.<|endoftext|>
|0| So you're going to do what she says. Right, let's all spendthe night at Natty Longshoe's Comical Castle.<|endoftext|>
|1| Artie?<|endoftext|>
|1| Firstly, if anybody's watching this, those children are undermy protection. I'm coming to get them. And secondly, little metalmachine, you are beautiful.<|endoftext|>
|1| Not even a Cybermat any more, eh? Cybermites.<|endoftext|>
|1| Now, there's a local transmat link open toyour home. If I can just find the frequency<|endoftext|>
|1| Hey, that really shouldn't have worked.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor, help us.<|endoftext|>
|1| Angie? Artie?<|endoftext|>
|1| Webley.<|endoftext|>
|0| We needed children, but the children had stopped coming. Youbrought us children. Hail to you, the Doctor, saviour of the Cybermen!<|endoftext|>
|0| What would the Empire do if they werealerted?<|endoftext|>
|0| I told you, tell me to blow up the planet.<|endoftext|>
|0| After they got us off.<|endoftext|>
|0| Captain, you want to take that one?<|endoftext|>
|0| No, ma'am. Just blow the sucker up.<|endoftext|>
|0| Drawbridge, moat, brilliant.<|endoftext|>
|0| With respect, ma'am, we ought to be hunting the creature.<|endoftext|>
|0| The only reason I'm still alive is that I do what the Doctorsays. Can you guarantee me you'd bring back my children alive andunharmed?<|endoftext|>
|0| I trust the Doctor.<|endoftext|>
|0| You think he knows what he's doing?<|endoftext|>
|0| I'm not sure I'd go that far.<|endoftext|>
|0| As the battle raged between humanity andthe Cyberiad, the Cyberplanners built a Valkyrie, to save criticallydamaged units and bring them here, and one by one, repair them.<|endoftext|>
|1| The people who vanished from the amusement park, they werespare parts for repairs.<|endoftext|>
|0| We've upgraded ourselves. The next model will be undefeatable.<|endoftext|>
|1| Nothing's undefeatable.<|endoftext|>
|0| We needed children to build a new Cyberplanner. A child'sbrain, with its infinite potential, is perfect for our needs. But we nolonger need the children. The Cybermites have been scanning your brain,Doctor. It's quite remarkable.<|endoftext|>
|1| Also completely useless to you. Cybermen use human parts. I'mnot human. You can't convert non-humans.<|endoftext|>
|0| Well, that was true a long time ago. But we've upgradedourselves. Current Cyberunits use almost any living components.<|endoftext|>
|0| Incorporated. Yes. Ah. Unfamiliar pulmonary set-up. Nervoussystem hyperconductive. Remarkable brain processing speed. Ho, ho.Amazing.<|endoftext|>
|1| Get out of my head!<|endoftext|>
|1| Stop rummaging in my mind.<|endoftext|>
|0| Just you try and stop me. Ooo, who's Clara. Why are youthinking about her so much?<|endoftext|>
|1| Enough.<|endoftext|>
|0| Fascinating. A complete mental block. Highly effective.<|endoftext|>
|0| Relax, relax. If you just relax, youwill find this a perfectly pleasant experience. You are being upgradedand incorporated into the Cyberiad as a Cyberplanner.<|endoftext|>
|1| Get out of my head!<|endoftext|>
|1| What is this place, a network? A hive?You're getting signals from every Cyberman everywhere. How many of youare there?<|endoftext|>
|0| Oh, this is brilliant. I'm so cleveralready, and now I'm a million times more clever. And what a brain. Nota human brain, not even slightly human. I mean, I'm going to have tocompletely rework the neural interface, but this is going to be themost efficient Cyberplanner. Not a great name, that, is it? I couldcall myself Mister Clever. So much raw data. Time Lords. There'sinformation on the Time Lords in here. Oh, this is just dreamy.<|endoftext|>
|1| Right, I'm allowing you access to memorieson Time Lord regeneration.<|endoftext|>
|0| Fantastic!<|endoftext|>
|1| I could regenerate right now. A big blast of regenerationenergy, burn out any little Cyberwidgets in my brain, along witheverything you're connected to. Don't want to. You use this me up, whoknows what we'll get next? But I can.<|endoftext|>
|0| Stalemate, then. One of us needs tocontrol this head. We're too well-balanced. What did you say? No, no,no, no, no. I heard you. Rhetorical device to keep me thinking about ita bit more. Stalemate?<|endoftext|>
|0| We each control forty nine point eighteight one percent of this brain. Point two three eight of the brain isstill in the balance. Whoever gets this gets the whole thing.<|endoftext|>
|1| Do you play chess?<|endoftext|>
|0| The rules of chess are in my memory banks. You're proposingwe play chess to end the stalemate?<|endoftext|>
|1| Winner takes all. Nobody can access that portion of the brainwithout winning the game.<|endoftext|>
|0| You can't win.<|endoftext|>
|1| Try me.<|endoftext|>
|0| You understand, when I do win, the Cyberiad gets your brainsand memories. All of it.<|endoftext|>
|1| When I win, you get out of my head, you let the children go,and nobody dies. You got that? Nobody dies!<|endoftext|>
|0| Castle's clear. Missy, confirmstatus.<|endoftext|>
|0| All clear in the power station.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's Missy. Something's out there.<|endoftext|>
|0| What do you mean? Is it the Cyberman?<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't know. I couldn't see it. It was only for a moment. Can Ihide? Is it okay if I hide?<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't move! I'm in the army!<|endoftext|>
|0| Er, ma'am. Missy said she saw something,and then she went quiet.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's on its way, then. Weapons. Show me. Only one gun?<|endoftext|>
|0| Cybermen have been extinct for a thousand years. Even oneAnti-Cyber gun is a miracle. These things are hand-pulsers. Touch theback of a Cyberman's head, the electomagnetic pulse deactivates it.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's this for? Just a mad guess here, it blows up the planet?<|endoftext|>
|0| Implodes it. There's also a trigger unit.<|endoftext|>
|0| I'll have that, then. Is there any other way to activate thebomb?<|endoftext|>
|0| It's set to respond to my voice. I have the verbal code.<|endoftext|>
|0| You will not activate it without a direct order from me.<|endoftext|>
|0| I will follow my orders.<|endoftext|>
|0| Your orders come from me, don't they?<|endoftext|>
|0| You'll need to sign for that trigger unit, ma'am.<|endoftext|>
|0| Thanks.<|endoftext|>
|0| Mind if I take one of these? Might be handy.<|endoftext|>
|0| Help yourself. I'll teach you how to use it. Upstairs. Now!<|endoftext|>
|0| There. That was easy. The game has just started. Doctor, whyis there no record of you anywhere in the databanks of the Cyberiad?Oh, you're good. Oh, you've been eliminating yourself from history. Youknow you could be reconstructed by the hole you've left.<|endoftext|>
|1| Good point. I'll do something about that.<|endoftext|>
|0| The rules of chess allow only a finitenumber of moves, and I can use other Cyberunits as remote processors.You cannot possibly win.<|endoftext|>
|1| I can. I know things you don't. For example, did you know veryearly versions of the Cyber operating system could be seriouslyscrambled by exposure to things, like gold, or cleaning fluid? Andwhat's interesting is, you're still running some of that code.<|endoftext|>
|0| Really. That's your secret weapon? Cleaning fluid?<|endoftext|>
|1| Nope, gold.<|endoftext|>
|1| Oh ho, ho! Like a charm. Right, you, Cyber Webley, and you kidthings. I'll bring the chessboard. Let's get out of here.<|endoftext|>
|0| You knew it was me.<|endoftext|>
|0| I was in the Imperial Guard on Caspertine. Mostly justparades, but I had the honour to guard the old Emperor during the icepicnic.<|endoftext|>
|0| When the snow bears came and danced for us. That was a day.<|endoftext|>
|0| We're a punishment platoon. We can't beat a Cyberman. TheImperium has to know what's happening.<|endoftext|>
|0| Like you said, the communicators are out. The only way youcan report this now is to activate the bomb.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| And I forbid you to do that.<|endoftext|>
|0| I don't get it. Why would you blow up a whole planet andeverybody on it just to get rid of one Cyberman?<|endoftext|>
|0| We tried other ways, but they only work sometimes, so now wetake drastic action. And it works.<|endoftext|>
|0| If you find a Cyberman and you can't destroy it immediately,you implode the planet. I was sent here because I didn't follow orders.I can make up for that.<|endoftext|>
|0| Put it down. I forbid you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Yeah. What she said.<|endoftext|>
|0| You ran away. I will do what I was brought up to do. Live forthe Empire, fight for the Empire, die for the Empire. This is CaptainAlice Ferrin, Imperial ID one nine delta one three B. Activate<|endoftext|>
|0| Cyberman! Get down!<|endoftext|>
|0| The Doctor said to get somewhere easily defensible, but if wejust stay in the castle it'll pick us off one by one. We have to takeit out.<|endoftext|>
|0| Is that an order, ma'am?<|endoftext|>
|0| Yes.<|endoftext|>
|0| Good.<|endoftext|>
|0| You know what to do.<|endoftext|>
|0| Pulse to the back of the head. Fry the brain circuit interface.<|endoftext|>
|0| It's going to be hard to get in close enough.<|endoftext|>
|0| I've heard about the Cybermen since I was in my cradle. I'm notafraid of you.<|endoftext|>
|0| Now!<|endoftext|>
|0| Hold it right there.<|endoftext|>
|0| What's happening to them?<|endoftext|>
|0| One more step and I fire.<|endoftext|>
|0| Don't fire that. A pulse will deactivate them.<|endoftext|>
|0| And anyway, it's a waste of charge. We may need it again.<|endoftext|>
|0| You don't think that was the only one, then?<|endoftext|>
|1| Argh! Don't shoot, don't shoot, I'm nice. Please, don't shoot.Hey, Clara, you haven't let them blow up the planet. Good job.<|endoftext|>
|0| Did you get the kids? Are they all right? What's going on?<|endoftext|>
|1| Er, a bit of a good news, bad news, good news again thing goingon. So, good news, I've kidnapped the Cyberplanner and right now I'msort of in control of this Cyberman.<|endoftext|>
|0| Bad news?<|endoftext|>
|1| Bad news, the Cyberplanner's in my head. And, different badnews, the kids are, well, it's complicated.<|endoftext|>
|0| Complicated how?<|endoftext|>
|1| Complicated as in walking coma.<|endoftext|>
|0| Please tell me you can wake them up.<|endoftext|>
|1| Hope so.<|endoftext|>
|0| Other good news?<|endoftext|>
|1| Well, in other good news, there are a few more repaired andreactivated Cybermen on the way, and the Cyberplanner's installing apatch for the gold thing. No, wait, that isn't good news, is it. Er,so, good news, I have a very good chance of winning my chess match.<|endoftext|>
|0| What?<|endoftext|>
|1| I'll explain later. In a bit of a hurry. Get me to a table, andsomebody tie me up! Need hands free for chess. And immobilise me,quickly.<|endoftext|>
|1| Right, that's good. I won't be able to move, but hands free.Good.<|endoftext|>
|0| You're playing chess with yourself?<|endoftext|>
|1| And winning.<|endoftext|>
|0| Actually, he has no better than a twenty five percent chanceof winning at this stage in the game. Some very dodgy moves at thebeginning. Hello, flesh girl. Fantastic. I'm the Cyberplanner.<|endoftext|>
|0| Doctor? <|endoftext|>
|0| Afraid not. I'm working the mouth now. Allons-y. Oh, youshould see the state of these neurons. He's had some cowboys in here.Ten complete re-jigs.<|endoftext|>
